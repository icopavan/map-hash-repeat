[[File:Jeremy Hinzmen.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Jeremy Hinzman]] first American Iraq war resister/deserter to seek refugee status in Canada.]]

Some soldiers of the [[coalition forces]] have refused to participate in the [[Iraq War]]. The following is a list of the more notable military personnel who have refused to participate in the Iraq War, broadly categorized by the reasons they themselves give.

==Objectors who fled to Canada==
{{Main|Canada and Iraq War resisters}}

===Background===
Some objectors chose [[Canada]] as the place of refuge in part of the closeness of the US-Canada Border, entry to Canada is easy and because of the precedence set by former Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] in allowing [[Canada and the Vietnam War#Draft dodgers|draft dodgers]] into Canada without prosecution during the [[History_of_Canada_(1960-1981)#Trudeau_and_the_1970s|Vietnam War]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Legal and political===
Pursuant to the ''Treaty between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America on Mutual Legal assistance in Criminal Matters'', US authorities can request Canadian authorities to identify, locate and take into custody of US nationals who have committed crime that carries a possible sentence of more than a year<ref>[http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/ca_us/en/cts.1990.19.en.html ''Treaty between the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America on Mutual Legal assistance in Criminal Matters'']</ref> and subsequently be extradited back to US pursuant to ''Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and Canada''.<ref>[http://www.oas.org/JURIDICO/mla/en/traites/en_traites-ext-usa-can.''Extradition Treaty Between the United States of America and Canada'']</ref> However, the government of the United States must promise those extradited will not receive death penalty in accordance with the ruling of [[United States v. Burns]] from the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].

Because the possibilities that [[deserters]] have been issued with arrest warrant back in the United States and pursuant to those two agreements above, they are liable for arrest in Canada unless they legalize their status. This can be done by pursuing a refugee claim which the [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]] will hold a hearing and determine their claim. If refused, they can appeal to the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]], [[Federal Court of Appeal]] and finally, [[Supreme Court of Canada]] if leave is granted.

However, if the refugee claim is refused and subsequent appeals do not overturn the decision made by IRB, the claimant must leave Canada within 30 days under a '''removal order'''.<ref>[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/inside/apply-after.asp The refugee system: Refugee claims in Canada – after applying]</ref> If the claimant does not leave Canada within 30 days or failed to confirm departure details with [[Canada Border Services Agency|CBSA]], it automatically becomes a '''deportation order''', enforceable by any peace officer in Canada.<ref>{{cite book |author=Government of Canada |year=2002 |title=You Asked about&nbsp;... immigration and citizenship|publisher=Queen's Printer for Candaa |page=66|isbn=0-662-66679-8}}</ref>
