The '''[[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|African American civil rights movement]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]''' has roots that extend back until at least 1912. With a history of [[Racial Tension in Omaha, Nebraska|racial tension]] that starts before the [[History of Omaha, Nebraska|founding of the city]], Omaha has been the home of numerous overt efforts related to securing [[civil rights]] for [[African Americans in Omaha, Nebraska|African Americans]] since at least the 1920s.

==Background==
{{African American topics sidebar|right}}
Prior to the formal founding of the civil rights movement in Omaha, several African Americans secured status that was relevant to later struggles. While the Civil Rights Movement proper did not begin until the 1940s, the historical significance of Omaha in securing civil rights for a variety of American people could be said to start in 1876.

That year stands out in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1896-1954)|American civil rights movement]] as Omaha became the location of the pivotal 1876 trial of ''[[Standing Bear v. Crook]]''. In that trial a U.S. district court judge at [[Fort Omaha]] set U.S. legal precedent by recognising the personhood of Native Americans, thereby granting American Indians the rights of citizens. With [[Standing Bear]], a [[Ponca]] chief on trail, local journalist [[Thomas Tibbles]], Omaha [[Susette LaFlesche]] and [[General Crook]] himself testified on behalf of acknowledging Native American rights. For the first time, a U.S. court had ruled that an Indian was, officially, a person. Standing Bear won the case, securing the right of his tribe to leave their [[Indian Territory]] reservation and return to their Nebraska homelands.<ref name="Bristow, D. 2002">Bristow, D.

The first record of community violence against blacks in Omaha occurred in 1891, when an African American man called [[Joe Coe]] was lynched by a vigilante mob for allegedly raping a [[Caucasian race|white]] girl.<ref name="Bristow, D. 2002"/> Another lynching occurred in 1919 when a white mob stormed the [[Douglas County Courthouse (Omaha)|Douglas County Courthouse]] to take [[Willy Brown]], an African American accused of raping a young white woman. While these incidents terrified the population of African Americans in the community and effectively segregated them from the rest of the city,<ref>(1994) ''Street of Dreams.'' (VHS) Nebraska Public Television.</ref> the civil rights movement in Omaha did not gain large-scale momentum until the 1920s.<ref>Bish, James D.

==Early years==
{{cquote|'''We Don't Serve Any Colored Race.'''<ref name="Preston-Love"/>}}

With early 20th century growth in the number of African American migrants recruited by the meatpacking industry, the population doubled from 1910-1920. Some groups in the city resisted such changes.  Some public places discriminated against African Americans, although segregation was not legal.  Up to the 1940s and 1950s, many of the city's restaurants were effectively segregated, with signs that stated, "We Don't Serve Any Colored Race."<ref name="Preston-Love">[[Preston Love]] reported seeing this sign repeatedly in Omaha cafes in the 1940s and 1950s in Bristow, D. (n.d.) [http://www.nebraskalife.com/PrestonLove.asp Swingin' with Preston Love]. ''Nebraska Life.''</ref>

The first organized effort for civil rights in Omaha was the creation of the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1912. At the national level, leadership and membership were integrated. The chapter has continued.<ref>(n.d.)[http://www.ketv.com/150thbirthday/3400699/detail.html Timeline: Omaha's 150th Birthday.] KETV.com</ref>

Other civil rights organizations soon formed in Omaha, part of the early 20th century spirit of reform that generated many progressive groups.  In 1917, [[George Wells Parker]] founded the [[Hamitic League of the World]] in Omaha. In 1918 the League published his pamphlet ''Children of the Sun.'' The Hamitic League was committed to black [[nationalism]]. Based in New York, Cyril Briggs became editor of their journal, ''The Crusader''.  It later became the journal of the [[African Blood Brotherhood]] (ABB).

In the 1920s, the Baptist minister Earl Little founded the Omaha chapter of [[Marcus Garvey|Marcus Garvey's]] [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]].  Little was the father of Malcolm, who later named himself [[Malcolm X]] when he became a Black Muslim minister and spokesman for the Nation of Islam. Malcolm X was [[Malcolm X House Site|born in Omaha]] in 1925, but his family moved away from the city while he was young.

There are reports of [[African Blood Brotherhood]]-related action in Omaha, particularly around the time of the [[Willy Brown]] lynching.  Witnessing the mob rule that overtook the city at the time of the lynching horrified many people.  One of those who was radicalized was [[Harry Haywood]], who went on to become involved with the African Blood Brotherhood. Later Haywood became a leading African American member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]].  He was active from the 1920s to his death in 1981.

The [[Urban League|Urban League of Nebraska]] had the first chapter founded in the [[American West]] of the national organization .<ref>(2007) [http://www.blackpast.org/?q=timelines/african-american-history-american-west-timeline African American History in the American West: Timeline.] University of Washington.</ref> Started in [[North Omaha]] in 1928, the Urban League of Nebraska was led by [[Whitney Young]], who quickly more than tripled the membership. The Urban League of Nebraska continues.<ref>(2007) [http://www.urbanleagueneb.org/our_history.htm Our History] Urban League of Nebraska.</ref>

During this period, the [[National Federation of Colored Women]] had five chapters in North Omaha with more than 750 members. They actively conducted a variety of social, political and charitable work throughout the city of Omaha.<ref>Nebraska Writers Project (n.d. ''est 1938) ''[http://www.memoriallibrary.com/NE/Ethnic/Negro/ Negroes in Nebraska]'' Works Progress Administration.</ref> Starting in 1920, the Colored Commercial Club organized to help blacks in Omaha secure employment and to encourage business enterprises among African Americans.

The [[South Omaha]] Stockyards employed a large portion of the city's African American workers from the South.  Working conditions there were often brutal.  These workers made significant gains after organizing with the [[I.W.W.]] in the 1920s.  During the Depression of the 1930s, however, they suffered setbacks when major [[packinghouse]]s closed.<ref>Larsen, L. and Cottrell, B.J. (1997) ''The Gate City: A History of Omaha.''</ref>

In the 1930s, a clandestine group called the [[Knights and Daughters of Tabor]] was founded in Omaha.  Also known as the "[[Knights of Liberty]]", it was a secret African-American organization whose goal was "nothing less than the destruction of slavery."<ref>(n.d.) [http://www.hariam.org/CASTLE/mosesdickson.htm Moses Dickson]</ref>

In 1938, [[Mildred Brown]] founded The ''[[Omaha Star]]''.  Starting with a circulation of 6,000, it  quickly became the city's only African-American newspaper, featuring positive news, role models and activities throughout the community. The paper strongly supported the local civil rights movement, for which it often featured successes and highlighted the challenges facing blacks in Omaha.  The ''Star'' reported proudly on the career of Captain Alfonza W. Davis, who fought with the [[Tuskegee Airmen]] during [[World War II]]. He was presumed [[Killed In Action]] when his aircraft disappeared over Germany in 1944.

== 1947 to 1962 ==

In 1947, a group of students developed the [[DePorres Club]]. Founded at [[Creighton University]],<ref>(1992) ''A Street of Dreams.'' Nebraska ETV Network (video)</ref> this club included African-American high school students and white [[Creighton University]] students who actively sought to fight racial discrimination in housing and the workplace.<ref>(n.d.)[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/stories/0801_0400.html Mildred Brown] ''Nebraska Studies.''</ref>

In the 1950s, the offices of the ''Omaha Star'' hosted the DePorres Club after Creighton banned them from campus. The club hosted a community center called the Omaha DePorres Center to meet the needs of low-income families.  It eventually started branches in Denver and Kansas City. According to one historian, "Their goals and tactics foreshadowed the efforts of [[civil rights]] activists throughout the nation in the 1960s."<ref>Taylor, Q. (2007) [http://www.blackpast.org/?q=timelines/african-american-history-american-west-timeline The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed - Timeline.] Seattle: University of Washington.</ref>

One of the early efforts led by the DePorres Club was the 1952-54 Omaha Bus Boycott. [[Mildred Brown]], a leader of the boycott, extolled readers of the ''Omaha Star'' to "Don’t ride Omaha’s buses or streetcars. If you must ride, protest by using 18 pennies." Focusing on ending the [[Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway Company]]'s policy of not hiring black drivers, the boycott was successful.<ref>[http://blog.nebraskahistory.org/?p=2361&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+nebraskahistory/oHtm+(Nebraska+State+Historical+Society+Blog) "Omaha’s Bus Boycott of 1952-54"], [[Nebraska State Historical Society]]. Retrieved 11/30/10.</ref>

In 1958, a group of African American educators in Omaha Public Schools started a professional caucus called Concerned and Caring Educators that continues to this day. The [[Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] preached at Salem Baptist Church in North Omaha late that same year.

==1963-1971==

During the 1960s, community activists liked to gather at North Omaha neighborhood locations, including the Fair Deal Cafe on 24th Street and Goodwin’s Spencer Street Barbershop at 3116 N. 24th Street, where young [[Ernie Chambers]] was a barber.<ref>"Cutting the path..."</ref> Other notable activists important to Omaha's African American community during this period included [[Rowena Moore]], [[Lois Mark Stalvey‎]], and [[Bertha Calloway]].

In 1963, a group of African American ministers from [[North Omaha]] formed a group called the "Citizens Civic Committee for Civil Liberties", or 4CL. The group rallied throughout the city to demand [[civil rights]] for all African Americans through picketing, stand-ins during city council meetings and other efforts.<ref name="A Street of Dreams.">''A Street of Dreams.''</ref> They set forth the formal agenda for Omaha's civil rights movement, with three main goals to be achieved through state legislation: to ensure equal housing opportunities and equal job opportunities for African Americans, and to secure integrated schools through busing for all African American students. That year local [[Youth activism|youth activists]] were successful in bringing down the color barrier at [[Peony Park]], the city's main amusement park, after protesting at the admission gates for several weeks.<ref>Hord, B.

According to the [[Nebraska Legislature]], civil rights demonstrations in Omaha in 1963 led to the creation of the Omaha Human Rights Commission.<ref>(n.d.) [http://www.unicam.state.ne.us/bluebook/intro/history.pdf History- Earliest records]. State of Nebraska Unicameral.</ref> According to a [[A Time for Burning|period documentary]], this commission was set up only to placate civil rights activists, and because of that, failed. 4CL and other groups also saw this Commission as a stalling tactic by Omaha's city leaders.<ref>[http://www.thereader.com/cover.php?subaction=showfull&id=1140741807&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& Cutting the path to freedom.] ''The Reader.''</ref>

Numerous national civil rights leaders made Omaha a stop on their speaking circuits. After Dr. King spoke in 1958, Malcolm X spoke in Omaha in 1964.<ref>Cutting the path.</ref> In 1966 [[Robert Kennedy]] visited North Omaha during his presidential campaign and spoke at Creighton University in support of Omaha's civil rights activists.

Starting in 1963, the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity (BANTU) was a unique Omaha [[youth activism]] group that organized African American students in the city's high schools. Focusing on [[black power]] and [[self-determination]], BANTU claimed concessions from the Omaha City Council, with Senator Edward R. Danners lobbying the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] on their behalf. BANTU maintained a unique relationship with the Omaha chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]] (BPP).  This may may have included being a recruiting group for the BPP.<ref>Howard, A. M. (2006, Sep) The Omaha Black Panther Party and BANTU: Exploitation or a Relationship of Mutual Convenience  Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, NA, Atlanta, GA.</ref>

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Black Panthers were actively organizing [[Freedom School]]s in Omaha's public housing projects.  They were blamed for starting several of the riots in the 1960s.<ref>(1992) ''A Street of Dreams.'' (VHS) Nebraska Public Television.</ref>

Achievements of the movement in Omaha included the desegregation of city facilities in the late 1950s, the 1964 event of Omahan [[Gale Sayers]] becoming the first African American NFL player to share a room with a white player,<ref>Brandt, G. "[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/9557566 Hall of Fame offers plenty of new intrigue], NFL.com website. Accessed 4/27/07."</ref> and the 1966 production of the [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated documentary ''[[A Time for Burning]]'', which tracked the sentiment of 1960s white Omaha towards African Americans. In 1968 [[Marlin Briscoe]], a football star and graduate of a [[Technical High School (Omaha, Nebraska)|local high school]], became the first black quarterback in the [[American Football League]], and in 1970 local barber and law school graduate [[Ernie Chambers]] was elected to the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] as the newest African American state legislator, preceded by other African Americans Edward Danner, John Adams Sr. and his son John Adams Jr. The Negro History Society formally opened the [[Great Plains Black History Museum]] in 1976 with the goal of celebrating African American contributions to the city and region.

While the Omaha [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s did not gain its goals of passage of state laws to ensure equal housing and job opportunities, it did succeed in securing integrated school busing, and employment with the municipal transit company, for example. The movement also was seen as successful in raising awareness of the inequities facing African Americans in Omaha.<ref name="A Street of Dreams."/>

==1972-present==
[[Image:P3160010.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Photo of [[Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr]] Cornerstone Memorial at the NW corner of 24th & Lake St in [[North Omaha]].]]

The City of Omaha installed the [[Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr]] Cornerstone Memorial at the NW corner of 24th & Lake Streets in 2002.  In 2003, native Omahan Thomas Warren was named the city’s first African American [[Chief of police|police chief]]. His advancement could be seen as part of the political progression of African Americans in the city.

In 2005, Ernie Chambers became the longest-serving State Senator in Nebraska history, with more than 32 years of service to his community and state.  Because of a term-limit bill enacted in the Nebraska State Legislature, Chambers was not be allowed to run for reelection when his term expired in 2008.<ref>Associated Press (April 25, 2005). For the Record. ''Lincoln Journal Star.'' Retrieved on 24 May 2006.</ref>

In response to [[West Omaha]] districts' concerns about schools, Senator Chambers proposed a controversial school separation plan for Omaha in the Nebraska State Legislature.  He lobbied to create three districts in the city.  Each was to be drawn along geographic boundaries that loosely correlated to the residential (and racial) housing patterns in the city: African Americans in [[North Omaha]], Hispanic/Latinos in [[South Omaha]], and Caucasians in West Omaha. The State Legislature signed [[Omaha Public Schools#Split the District|this plan]] into law in April 2006.

Within a month, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] brought a [[lawsuit]].  It argued that due to Omaha's racially segregated residential patterns, subdivided school districts will also be racially segregated, contrary to the historic case of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sam Dillon |title=Schools Plan in Nebraska Is Challenged |publisher=New York Times |date=May 17, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/us/17naacp.html }}</ref>
