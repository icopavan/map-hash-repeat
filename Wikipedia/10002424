[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1951&dat=19881202&id=nJ8oAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-4cFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4703,639324] The Tide ended the season with a win against Army in the [[1988 Sun Bowl]], in which McCants had a game-high 13 tackles.[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=I9xHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pP8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=1939,7041580&dq=keith+mccants+award&hl=en]

Three weeks later, he was named ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' defensive player of the week after totaling 18 tackles in an Alabama victory over [[LSU]]. In the last game of the 1989 regular season against [[Auburn University|Auburn]], dubbed the [[Iron Bowl]], McCants was named the CBS Player of the Game for Alabama with 18 tackles, an interception, and a forced fumble.  A high point for the Tide from the game was McCants' display of "incredible athletic talent" in running down Auburn receiver Shane Wasden from behind and preventing a touchdown.<ref name="rolltide"/> Additionally, it was the second straight Iron Bowl in which McCants led the Tide in tackles, combining for 35 total between the 1988 and 1989 matchups. McCants 119 tackles that year puts him tied for 6th all time for tackles in a single season by an Alabama player.<ref>http://www.rolltide.com/archive_files/files/football/2004/gamenotes/bama_kentucky.pdf</ref> Among a number of individual honors, McCants finished his college career with 197 total tackles, including 16 tackles for a loss.<ref>http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/history-stats.pdf</ref>  The February 12th, 1990 issue of Sports Illustrated ran an article that focused on McCants titled "The Young and the Restless", that profiled his and other college juniors' eventually successful attempts to declare for the NFL Draft before their senior season, a then-uncommon practice.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1069350/1/index.htm Alabama linebacker Keith McCants heads a group of some - 02.12.90 - SI Vault<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://exploreuk.uky.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=ukmbbprog;cc=ukmbbprog;q1=keith%20mccants;rgn=full%20text;idno=ukawcp1989_14_21;didno=ukawcp1989_14_21;view=pdf;seq=17;passterms=1 University of Kentucky Men's Basketball Programs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In December 2010, [[Bleacher Report]] named McCants the 33rd greatest player in Alabama Crimson Tide History.<ref>[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/536070-the-50-greatest-players-in-alabama-crimson-tide-football-history/page/18 The 50 Greatest Players In Alabama Crimson Tide Football History | Bleacher Report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Professional career==
McCants was for a time expected to be the first player selected in the [[1990 NFL Draft|1990 NFL draft]], but the [[Atlanta Falcons]] backed off due to rumors of knee trouble and allegations that his family had been paid money by a sports agent while he was still in college.<ref>Associated Press. "Falcons sour on McCants, want George with top pick". The Gadsden Times. 11 Apr 1990.</ref> After being drafted fourth overall by the Buccaneers in 1990, McCants signed a 5 year, $7.4 million dollar deal with the team, including a then-record $2.5 million dollar cash signing bonus.[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4KxdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jV0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3353,1712387&dq=keith+mccants+named&hl=en] <ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-11/sports/sp-416_1_buccaneers-sign-keith-mccants Buccaneers Sign Keith McCants for $7.4 Million - Los Angeles Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  A highly touted prospect, McCants rookie card by [[Score Entertainment|Score]] quoted former Kentucky head coach [[Jerry Claiborne]] as saying ''"Keith is one of the best football players I have ever seen.  Have you ever seen a linebacker as big as he is? I never have.  He looks like an elephant and he runs like a deer"''. Buccaneers coach [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]], McCants' former college coach, said that "He plays like he is never out of the play. That is an intensity level I like".<ref>Pino, Mark. "McCants signs, gets serious about football". The Ocala Star-Banner. 13 Jul 1990</ref>

McCants had difficulty adjusting to playing linebacker in the NFL and was converted to [[defensive end]] for the 1991 season. Previously timed at 4.51 seconds for the [[40-yard dash]], after the transition he lost speed. Tampa Bay also drafted him not knowing that he had sustained a serious knee injury.  McCants did have some success, as he led the Buccaneers in 1991 with 34 quarterback pressures, and was second on the Buccaneers in sacks (5) and quarterback pressures (21) in 1992. Eventually, Tampa Bay cut him during their 1993 [[National Football League Training Camp|training camp]].  In 1993 while with the Houston Oilers, McCants stepped in to separate [[Buddy Ryan]] and [[Kevin Gilbride]] when Ryan punched Gilbride in the face following an Oiler's fumble.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPK3cDl7Ftw ‪Buddy Ryan punching Kevin Gilbride‬‏ - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  That season, the Oilers would go on to finish 1st in the [[AFC Central]] Division.  In 1994, McCants' 46-yard touchdown was the Cardinals' longest interception return of the season.<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/teams/arizonacardinals/statistics?season=1994&team=ARI&seasonType= Arizona Cardinals Stats at NFL.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  McCants retired from the NFL in 1995.

==Personal life==
McCants and [[Emmitt Smith]] became friends while both playing in the SEC in college, with both being named to the 1989 All American team.  Smith twice called McCants for advice leading up to his decision to announce for the 1990 Draft.[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB7C44141A3306A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM]  According to her biography, while still a child [[WNBA]] player [[Lindsey Harding]] was inspired by a footrace with McCants to enter the world of sports.[http://www.actorspages.org/marsharandolph/bio.php?page=bio].  McCants recently launched his own website, www.keithmccants.com, which he plans on using as a platform to present his take on topical football and sports commentary.  He now maintains a Twitter account and Facebook fan page as well.

==Legal troubles==
According to a May 15, 2011 Tampa Tribune article, since 2002 McCants has had three convictions on charges of possessing drugs or drug paraphernalia.<ref>Johnston, Joey.
