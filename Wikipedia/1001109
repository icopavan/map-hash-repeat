'''Herman Badillo'''  (born August 21, 1929) is a [[Bronx, New York]] politician who has been a [[borough president]], [[United States Representative]], and candidate for [[Mayor of New York City]]. He was the first Puerto Rican to be elected to these posts and be a mayoral candidate in the continental United States.

==Early years==

Badillo was born in [[Caguas, Puerto Rico]]. When he was 11 years old, both of his parents died of [[tuberculosis]] and he was sent to live with his aunt in [[New York City]]. After graduating from the [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] system, Badillo attended and earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] from the [[City College of New York]] in 1951.  In 1954, he received an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] from [[Brooklyn Law School]] graduating first in his class.  The next year he was admitted to the New York State Bar.  In 1956, he also became a [[certified public accountant]].<ref name="AA">[http://triallaw1.com/attorneys/members_ofcounsel_profile.jsp;jsessionid=DA262790816C48134259A3911E9054B8?type=1&attorneyid=75 "Of Counsel Profile"] - biography on law firm website</ref><ref name="AB">[http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/congress/badillo.html Hispanic Americans in Congress--Badillo]</ref><ref name="AC">[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2001/vol5n33/ProfBadillo-en.shtml Puerto Rico Herald: Puerto Rico Profile: Herman Badillo]</ref><ref name="AD">[http://www.nyccfb.info/debates_vg/voter_guides/primary_2001/cd_statements/m_hbadillo.htm [[New York City Campaign Finance Board]]: The 2001 Voter Guides]</ref><ref name="AF">[http://www.nypress.com/14/36/nyc/nyc.cfm Badillo for Mayor] Endorsement by the New York Press.</ref><ref name="AE">[http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/badillo.htm Manhattan Institute Scholar Herman Badillo]</ref><ref name="AG">[http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/news/regionalnews/badillo_lashes_latinos_regionalnews_carl_campanile.htm Badillo Lashes Latinos]</ref><ref name="AH">[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00912F835580C768EDDAF0894D0494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fR%2fRepublican%20Party Badillo Is Said to Be Switching to the Republicans]</ref><ref name="AI">[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GeorgeWill/2001/08/30/the_best_candidate_wont_win_this_time The best candidate won't win this time] by [[George Will]]</ref><ref name="AJ">[http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110009450 Stalled in America] (Why one Hispanic immigrant is being trashed for his blueprint for success)</ref>

==Early political career==
In 1958, Badillo joined the "[[Caribbean|Caribe]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Club" and has since then held various offices within the City and State, including [[Bronx]] [[Borough President]] in 1965. Prior to becoming the Borough President, he served as New York Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1970, Badillo was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from New York's 21st District in the [[Bronx|South Bronx]], thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to so serve. He was also re-elected for three subsequent consecutive terms. He was also a member of the [[Committee on Education and Labor]].<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>  

In 1976 he was challenged by [[South Bronx]] Councilman Ramon Velez in a contest for the Democratic Party nomination for Congressman of the 21st District. Badillo, however, was reelected easily with 75 percent of the vote. In December of that year, he was one of the five Latino members of Congress who established the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus]].<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/> Largely by his efforts, job training for unemployed non-[[English language|English]] speaking citizens were included in the "Comprehensive Manpower Act of 1973".

Badillo also served on the [[Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee]], and the [[Small Business Committee]] where he had a seat on the Minority Enterprise and General Oversight Sub-committee. During his time in office he supported legislation intended to counteract various types of discrimination including age and marital status discrimination in employment.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

Although he would later become a vociferous opponent of [[bilingual education]], as a congressman Badillo was one of the first champions of funding for bilingual education programs. Some proponents of bilingual and [[ESL]] education, and opponents of English [[immersion]], have attacked Badillo for his newfound opposition to Spanish-language teaching. He was also a critical player in the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and the inclusion of its language access provisions. During his tenure in Congress, he became an important national spokesperson for federal investment in urban centers.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

==Mayoral campaigns==

He sought unsuccessfully the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York in 1969, 1973, [[New York City mayoral election, 1977|1977]], 1981 and 1985, coming closest on his second try, when he was defeated by then-New York City comptroller [[Abe Beame]] in a runoff [[primary election|primary]]. In 2001, Badillo unsuccessfully sought the Republican mayoral nomination, losing badly to billionaire businessman and political neophyte Michael Bloomberg, who would later prevail in the general election.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

==Deputy Mayor of New York City==

Badillo resigned from Congress on December 31, 1977 to become [[deputy mayor]] of New York City under Mayor [[Ed Koch]], a position he held until September 1979.  Badillo was one of seven deputy mayors appointed by Koch for the first portion of his administration.  As a deputy mayor, Badillo handled labor relations and community outreach for Koch.  In a major public disagreement with Mayor Koch over the lack of support for his program to revitalize the South Bronx, Badillo resigned his post. Some argue that Badillo made a major career mistake in giving up his Congressional post for this appointed position under Mayor Koch.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

==Post City Hall career and State Comptroller campaign==
After leaving City Hall, Badillo worked as an attorney in New York City. He supported [[Mario Cuomo]] for governor over Koch during the 1982 Democratic Primary. In late 1983 Cuomo appointed Badillo Chairman of the [[State of New York Mortgage Agency]].  In 1985 Badillo considered a bid for mayor against Koch in the Democratic Primary.  In 1986, Badillo was the Democratic nominee for [[New York State Comptroller]], losing to Republican incumbent [[Edward Regan]]. During these years Badillo was also active in Presidential politics, supporting [[Alan Cranston]] for the Democratic Presidential Nomination in 1984 and [[Michael Dukakis]] in 1988.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

==City Comptroller campaign==

In 1993, Badillo, though still a Democrat, campaigned for Comptroller of New York City on a [[Electoral fusion|"fusion"]] basis with Republican [[Rudy Giuliani]].  He also sought the Democratic nomination, but finished third, behind [[Alan Hevesi]] and the incumbent Comptroller, [[Elizabeth Holtzman]].  In the general election, although Giuliani won the mayoralty, Badillo lost to Hevesi.  For the general election, Badillo was the nominee of the Republican and Liberal Parties.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

==Giuliani Administration and CUNY Chairmanship==

Badillo had a series of jobs with the Giuliani administration, he serving as the mayor's Special Counsel on education policy and as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the [[City University of New York]].<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>  

In his capacity as Giuliani's education advisor, Badillo advocated increased Mayoral control of the public schools and a revamped curriculum; he was also Giuliani's liaison to the City's Board of Education.  As CUNY Chairman, Badillo organized a successful effort to end open enrollment and revamp the curriculum. These actions gained him some support among conservatives, but alienated him from the mainstream of the Puerto Rican political leadership, which had been his traditional base.

==Republican Party switch and 2001 Mayoral campaign==
During the late 1990s, Badillo formally joined the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. He resigned as education special counsel and CUNY Chairman when he announced his candidacy for Mayor in 2001. Despite his strong support of Mayor Giuliani, Badillo never received serious support from Giuliani or the Republican Party during his bid for Mayor, losing badly the Republican primary to billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who had just switched from Democrat to Republican, as Badillo had done earlier.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

==Current career==
Badillo is now dedicated to his law practice in New York. In 2005 he became "[[of counsel]]" to the New York City law firm of [[Sullivan Papain Block McGrath & Cannavo]] P.C. In 2006, he joined the conservative [[Manhattan Institute]] of Policy Research as a senior fellow.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/> In January 2011, Badillo joined national personal injury law firm [[Parker Waichman Alonso]] as a senior counsel in its New York office. <ref>http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2011/01/herman-badillo-to-parker-waichman-alonso</ref>

==New book==

His first published book, written at age 77 and released on December 28, 2006, ''One Nation, One Standard: An Ex-Liberal on How Hispanics Can Succeed Just Like Other Immigrant Groups'', Penguin (December 28, 2006), hardcover, 256 pages, ISBN 1595-23019-X, ISBN 13 978-1595-23019-5, generated major controversy within the Latino community before it was even published because of an inflammatory article in the ''New York Post'' (Dec. 19, 2006, p.&nbsp;8) announcing its release. In the book, Badillo criticizes what he perceives as a lax work ethic among Hispanics, who he contends do not value education as much as other historically impoverished, but successful, immigrants, such as Asian-Americans.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>

In contrast to the support he gave to bi-lingual education during his  early career, his book attacks what he describes as obstacles to assimilation, such as bilingual education, and urges Hispanics to eschew government solutions and adopt instead the cultural values that have made previous generations of American immigrants prosperous and successful. His view is that Hispanics will soon make up 25% of the population of the United States and that their failure to excel would be tragic for them and the nation.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="AB"/><ref name="AC"/><ref name="AD"/><ref name="AF"/><ref name="AE"/><ref name="AG"/><ref name="AH"/><ref name="AI"/><ref name="AJ"/>
