===References from Vedas===
One phrase of the Rig Veda appears to indicate an epithet that has been attributed to the form of Vishnu as Narasimha. It clearly calls the qualities of Vishnu that are seen only in this [[avatar]] as "like some wild beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming" ([[RV.I]] 154.2a). There is a reference or an allusion to knowledge of Namuci story in [[RV.VIII]] 14.13: "With waters' foam you tore off, Indra, the head of Namuci, subduing all contending hosts." This short reference is believed to have culminated in the full puranic story of this highly popular Narasimha form.<ref name = "Soifer"/>

===Narasimha and Prahlada===
[[Image:Narasimha LACMA.jpg|thumb|right|Narasimha kills [[Hiranyakashipu]], as [[Prahlada]] and his mother bow before Lord Narasimha]]
The story of Narasimha as described in the [[Bhagavata Purana]] is as follows: 

In his previous avatara of [[Varaha]], Vishnu killed a [[rakshasa]] known as [[Hiranyaksha]]. Hiranyaksha's brother [[Hiranyakashipu]], greatly angered by this, started to abhor Vishnu and his followers. He decides to attempt to kill Vishnu by gaining [[mystical]] powers, which he believes [[Brahma]], the chief among the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]], will award him if he undergoes many years of great austerity and [[penance]]. This initially seems to work as planned with Brahma becoming pleased by Hiranyakashipu's austerities.<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/4/1/en1 Bhag-P 7.4.1] "Lord Brahma was very much satisfied by Hiranyakasipu's austerities, which were difficult to perform"</ref> Brahma thus appears before Hiranyakashipu and offers him a boon that he will personally make true anything he wishes for. In reply, Hiranyakashipu requests the following:

<blockquote>
O my lord, O best of the givers of benediction, if you will kindly grant me the benediction I desire, please let me not meet death from any of the living entities created by you.

Grant me that I not die within any residence or outside any residence, during the daytime or at night, nor on the ground or in the sky. Grant me that my death not be brought about by any weapon, nor by any human being or animal.

Grant me that I not meet death from any entity, living or nonliving created by you. Grant me, further, that I not be killed by any demigod or demon or by any great snake from the lower planets. Since no one can kill you in the battlefield, you have no competitor. Therefore, grant me the benediction that I too may have no rival. Give me sole lordship over all the living entities and presiding deities, and give me all the glories obtained by that position. Furthermore, give me all the mystic powers attained by long austerities and the practice of yoga, for these cannot be lost at any time.<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/3/en1 Bhag-P, Canto 7]  7.3.35-38</ref>
</blockquote>

[[File:Narasimha statue at National Museum, New Delhi.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Narasimha statue]]
One day while Hiranyakashipu is performing austerities at Mandaracala Mountain, his home is attacked by [[Indra]] and the other [[Deva (Hinduism)|devatas]].<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/6/en1 Bhag-P 7.7.6] "The victorious demigods plundered the palace of Hiranyakasipu, the king of the demons, and destroyed everything within it. Then Indra, King of heaven, arrested Prahalada's mother and Hiranyakasipu's wife Kayadu, the Queen"</ref> At this point the [[rishi|divine sage]] [[Narada]] intervenes to protect Kayadu, whom he describes as 'sinless'.<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/8/en1 Bhag-P 7.7.8] "Narada Muni said: O Indra, King of the demigods, this woman is certainly sinless. You should not drag her off in this merciless way. This chaste woman is the wife of another. You must immediately release her."</ref> Following this event, Narada takes Kayadu into his care and while under the guidance of Narada, her unborn child (Hiranyakashipu's son) [[Prahlada]], becomes affected by the transcendental instructions of the sage even at such a young stage of development. Thus, Prahlada later begins to show symptoms of this earlier training by Narada, gradually becoming recognised as a devoted follower of Vishnu, much to his father's disappointment.<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/6/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.6]</ref>

Hiranyakashipu eventually becomes so angry and upset at his son's devotion to Vishnu (whom he sees as his mortal enemy) that he decides he must kill him,<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/3-4/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.3-4] "Thus he finally decided to kill his son Prahlada. Hiranyakasipu was by nature very cruel</ref> but each time he attempts to kill the boy, Prahlada is protected by Vishnu's mystical power. When asked, Prahlada refuses to acknowledge his father as the supreme lord of the universe and claims that Vishnu is all-pervading and [[omnipresent]]. Hiranyakashipu points to a nearby pillar and asks if 'his Vishnu' is in it:

<blockquote> "O most unfortunate Prahlada, you have always described a supreme being other than me, a supreme being who is above everything, who is the controller of everyone, and who is all-pervading. But where is He? If He is everywhere, then why is He not present before me in this pillar?"<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/12/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.12]</ref></blockquote> 

[[File:Narasimha Cambodia.jpg||thumb|Narasimha claws Hiranyakasipu at [[Banteay Srei]] in Cambodia.]]
Prahlada then answers, ''He was, He is and He will be''.  In an alternate version of the story, Prahlada answers, ''He is in pillars, and he is in the smallest twig''. Hiranyakashipu, unable to control his anger, smashes the pillar with his mace, and following a tumultuous sound, Vishnu in the form of Narasimha appears from it and moves to attack his father in defence of Prahlada. In order to kill Hiranyakashipu and not upset the boon given by [[Brahma]], the form of Narasimha is chosen. Hiranyakashipu can not be killed by human, deva or animal. Narasimha is neither one of these as he is a form of Vishnu incarnate as a part-human, part-animal.  He comes upon Hiranyakashipu at twilight (when it is neither day nor night) on the threshold of a courtyard (neither indoors nor out), and puts the demon on his thighs (neither earth nor space). Using his sharp fingernails (neither [[animate]] nor [[inanimate]]) as weapons, he disembowels and kills the demon.<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/8/29/en1 Bhag-P 7.8.29] "Lord Narasimhadeva placed the demon on his lap, supporting him with his thighs, and in the doorway of the assembly hall the lord very easily tore the demon to pieces with the nails of his hand."</ref> Kurma Purana describes the preceding battle between the [[Purusha]] and demonic forces in which he escapes a powerful weapon called ''Pashupata'' and it describes how Prahlada's brothers headed by Anuhrada and thousands of other demons "were led to the valley of death (yamalayam) by the lion produced from the body of man-lion" avatara.<ref name="Soifer">p.85: K.P.1.15.70</ref> The same episode occurs in the ''Matshya Purana'' 179, several chapters after its version of the Narasimha advent.<ref name = "Soifer"/>

The Bhagavata Purana further narrates: even after killing Hiranyakashipu, none of the present demigods are able to calm Narasimha's fury, not even [[Shiva]]. So all the gods and goddesses call his consort, [[Lakshmi]], but she is also unable to do so. Then, at the request of Brahma, Prahlada is presented to Narasimha, and finally he is calmed by the prayers of his devotee.<ref>[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/9/en1 Bhag-P 7.9]</ref> Before parting, Narasimha rewards the wise Prahlada by crowning him as the king.

===Narasimha and Adi Shankara===
It is believed by followers that Narasimha protects his sincere devotees when they are in extreme danger.
Near Srisailam, there is a forest called Hatakeshwanam, that no man enters. Shankaracharya entered this place and did penance for many days. During this time, a Kapalika, by name Kirakashan appeared before him. Kapalikas are a set of people who live in the burial grounds and pray to God by giving human and animal sacrifice. They were against Vedanta system of Adi Shankara which preaches love and affection and shuns violence. He told Sri Sankara that he should give his body as a human sacrifice to [[Kali]]. Sankara was happy to hear this request and agreed. His disciples were shocked to hear this and pleaded Shankara to change his mind but Shankara refused to do so saying that it was an honour to give up his body as a sacrifice for [[Kali]] and one must not lament over such things. The Kapalika arranged a fire for the sacrifice and asked Shankara to sit beside it. Just as he lifted his axe to severe Shankara's head, [[Lord Vishnu]] as Narasimha entered the body OF Shankaracharya's disciple, Padmapada, who was a devotee of Narasimha, and fought the Kapalika, slayed him and thus freed the forest of Kapalikas. Thus Adi Sankara composed the very powerful [http://www.hindudevotionalblog.com/2008/08/sri-lakshmi-narasimha-karavalamba.html Lakshmi-Narasimha Karavalambam Stotram] at the very spot in front of Lord Narasimha.

==Mode of worship==
Due to the nature of Narasimha's form (divine anger), it is essential that worship be given with a very high level of attention compared to other deities. In many temples only life-long celibates ([[brahmacarya]]) will be able to have the chance to serve as priests to perform the daily [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]]. Forms where Narasimha appears sitting in a [[yoga|yogic]] posture, or with the goddess [[Lakshmi]] are the exception to this rule, as Narasimha is taken as being ''more relaxed'' in both of these instances compared to his form when first emerging from the pillar to protect Prahlada.

===Prayers===
A number of prayers have been written in dedication to Narasimha avatar. These include:
<blockquote>
The Narasimha Maha-Mantra

:''Om Hreem Kshraum Ugram Veeram Mahaa-Vishnum,''
:''Jwalantham Sarvatho Mukham''
:''Nrisimham Bheeshanam Bhadram''
:''Mrityu-Mrityum Namaamyaham.''

"O' Angry and brave Maha-Vishnu, your heat and fire permeate everywhere. O Lord Narasimha, you are everywhere. You are the death of death and I surrender to You."
</blockquote>

:''ito nrsimhah parato nrsimho,''
:''yato yato yami tato nrsimhah,''
:''bahir nrsimho hrdaye nrsimho,''
:''nrsimham adim saranam prapadye''
</blockquote>
"Lord Nrsimha is here and also there. Wherever I go Lord Narasimha is there. 
He is in the heart and is outside as well. I surrender to Lord Narasimha, 
the origin of all things and the supreme refuge." (Narasimha Pranama)<ref name="ReferenceA">Steven J. Rosen, ''Narasimha Avatar, The Half-Man/Half-Lion Incarnation''</ref>

[[Image:Narsingh.jpg|thumb|Narasimha deity in Bhaktapur Darbar, [[Nepal]]]]
<blockquote>
:''tava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-srngam,''
:''dalita-hiranyakasipu-tanu-bhrngam,''
:''kesava dhrta-narahari-rupa jaya jagadisa hare''
</blockquote>
"O Kesava! O Lord of the universe. O Lord Hari, who have assumed the form of half-man, half-lion! All glories to You! Just as one can easily crush a wasp between one's fingernails, so in the same way the body of the wasplike demon Hiranyakasipu has been ripped apart by the wonderful pointed nails on your beautiful lotus hands." (from the Dasavatara-stotra composed by [[Jayadeva]])<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

</blockquote>
:''Tvayi Rakshathi Rakshakai: Kim Anyai:,''
:''Tvayi Cha Arakshati Rakshakai: Kim Anyai:,''
:''Ithi Nischita Dhee: Srayaami Nityam,''
:''Nruhareh: Vegavathee Tataasrayam Tvam!''
</blockquote>

"O Kamasikha Narasimha! you are ''sarva sakthan''. When you are resolved to protect some one, where is the need to seek the protection of anyone else? When you are resolved not to protect some one, which other person is capable of protecting us?. There is no one. Knowing this fundamental truth, I have resolved to offer my [[saranagati]] at your lotus feet alone that rest at the banks of Vegavathi river." (Kamasika Ashtakam by [[Vedanta Desika]])

</blockquote>
:''ADi ADi agam Karaindhu isai''
:''PADip PADik KaNNIr Malgi engum''
:' nADi nADi narasingA endru,''
:''VADi VADum ivvAL nuthalE!''
</blockquote>

"I will dance and melt for you, within my heart, to see you, I will sing in praise of you with tears in joy, I will search for Narasimha and I am a householder who still searches to reach you (to attain Salvation)." ([[Divya Prabandham]] 2954)

== Symbolism ==
*Narasimha indicates God's omnipresence and the lesson is that God is everywhere.  For more information, see [[Vaishnava Theology]].

*Narasimha demonstrates God's willingness and ability to come to the aid of His devotees, no matter how difficult or impossible the circumstances may appear to be. 

*Prahlada's devotion indicates that pure devotion is not one of birthright but of character. Prahlada, although born a rakshasa, demonstrated the greatest [[bhakti]] to God, and endured much, without losing faith.

==Significance==
In South Indian art – sculptures, bronzes and paintings – Vishnu's incarnation as Narasimha is one of the most chosen themes and amongst [[Avatar]]s perhaps next only to [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] in popularity.<br />
<br />
Lord Narasimha also appears as one of [[Hanuman]]'s 5 faces, who is a significant character in the [[Ramayana]] as Lord Raam's([[Rama]]) devotee.

== Cultural Tradition of Procession (श्री नृसिंह यात्रा) ==
[[File:Nrisimha Jatra marked in Lalitpur district of Nepal.jpg|thumb|The Nrisimha Yatra of [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Nepal]]]]
In [[Rajopadhyaya]] Brahmins of Nepal, there is a tradition of celebrating the procession ceremony of the deity Narasimha avatar, in [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur]] district of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] in [[Nepal]]. The fifth day of holy Shrawan (श्रावण) month  i.e. Shrawan Krishna Panchami of the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu Lunar Calender]] is marked as auspicious day for the religious procession, Nrisimha Yatra(नृसिंह यात्रा). This tradition of the holy procession has been held for more than a hundred years. This is one of the typical traditions of the [[Rajopadhyaya]] Bramhins, the Hindu [[Bramins of Nepal|Bramhans]] of the locality [http://www.rajopadhyaya.org]. 

In this [[Nrisimha]] Yatra (श्री नृसिंह यात्रा), each year one male member of the [[Rajopadhyaya]] [http://www.rajopadhyaya.org] community gets the chance to be the organizer each year in that particular day. He gets his turn according to the sequence in their record, where the names of [[Rajopadhyaya]] bramhins are registered when a bramhan [http://www.rajopadhyaya.org] lad is eligible to be called as a [[Bramins of Nepal|Bramhan]].<ref>A person is eligible for all kinds of rituals as a Bramhan only after his Chudakarma is marked.</ref>

==Forms of Narasimha==
There are several forms of Narasimha, but nine main ones collectively known as Navanarasimha:

==Early images of Narasimha==
In [[Andhra Pradesh]], a panel dating to third-fourth century AD shows a full theriomorphic squatting lion with two extra human arms behind his shoulders holding [[Vaishnava]] emblems. This lion, flanked by five heroes (''viras''), often has been identified as an early depiction of Narasimha.<ref>Abdul Waheed Khan, ''An Early Sculpture of Narasimha'', Andhra Pradesh Government Archaeological Series 16, Hyderabad: Government of Andhra Pradesh, 1964.</ref> Standing cult images of Narasimha from the early Gupta period, survive from temples at Tigowa and Eran.<ref>Alexander Cunningham, Archaeological Survey of India, Annual Reports IX (1873-75), p.47</ref> These sculptures are two-armed, long maned, frontal, wearing only a lower garment, and with no demon-figure of Hiranyakashipu. Images representing the narrative of Narasimha slaying the demon Hiranyakasipu survive from slightly later Gupta-period temples: one at Madhia and one from a temple-doorway now set into the Kumra-math at Nachna, both dated to the late fifth or early sixth century A.D.<ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301">Michael W. Meiste, ''Man and Man-Lion: The Philadelphia Narasiṁha'', Artibus Asiae, Vol. 56, No. 3/4 (1996), pp. 291-301</ref> 

An image of Narasimha supposedly dating to second-third century AD sculpted at [[Mathura]] was acquired by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1987. It was described by Stella Kramrisch, the former Philadelphia Museum of Art's Indian curator, as "perhaps the earliest image of Narasimha as yet known".<ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301"/> This figure depicts a furled brow, fangs, and lolling tongue similar to later images of Narasimha, but the idol's robe, simplicity, and stance set it apart. On Narasimha's chest under his
upper garment appears the suggestion of an amulet, which Stella Kramrisch associated with Visnu's cognizance, the Kaustubha jewel. This upper garment flows over both shoulders; but below
Hiranyakasipu, the demon-figure placed horizontally across Narasimha's body, a twisted waist-band suggests a separate garment covering the legs. The demon's hair streams behind him, cushioning his head against the man-lion's right knee. He
wears a simple single strand of beads. His body seems relaxed, even pliant. His face is calm, with a slight suggestion of a smile. His eyes stare adoringly up at the face of Vishnu. There is little tension in this figure's legs or feet, even as Narasimha gently disembowels him. His innards spill along his right side. As the [[Matsya purana]] describes it, Narasimha ripped "apart the mighty Daitya chief as a plaiter of straw mats shreds his reeds".<ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301"/> Based on the [[Gandhara]]-style of robe worn by the idol, Michael Meiste altered the date of the image to fourth century AD.<ref name="Michael W. Meiste 1996 pp. 291-301"/> 

Deborah Soifer, a scholar who worked on texts in relation to Narasimha, believes that "the traits basic to Vishnu in the Veda remain central to Vishnu in his avataras" and points out, however, that: "we have virtually no precursors in the Vedic material for the figure of a man-lion, and only one phrase that
simply does not rule out the possibility of a savage side to the benign Vishnu". Soifer speaks of "the enigma" of Vishnu's Narasimha avatara and comments that "how the myth arrived at its rudimentary form [first recorded in the [[Mahabharata]]], and where the figure of the man-lion came from remain unsolved mysteries.".<ref>Soifer, 73</ref> 

An image of Narasimha, dating to the 9th century, was found on the northern slope of Mount Ijo, at Prambanan, Indonesia.<ref>Jan Fontein, et al. (1990). The sculpture of Indonesia, p.145</ref> Images of Thrivikrama and Varaha avataras were also found at Prambanan, Indonesia. Vishnu and His avatara images follow iconographic pecularities characteristic of the art of central Java. This includes physiognomy of central Java, an exaggerated volume of garment, and some elaboration of the jewelry. This decorative scheme once formulated became, with very little modification, an accepted norm for sculptures throughout the Central Javanese period (circa 730-930 A.D.). Despite the iconographic peculiarities, the stylistic antecedents of the Java sculptures can be traced back to Indian carvings as the Chalukya and Pallava images of the 6th-7th centuries AD.<ref>Debjani Paul (1978) ''Deity or Deified King? Reflections on a Unique Vaiṣṇavite Sculpture from Java', Artibus Asiae, Vol. 40, No. 4 (1978), pp. 311-333.</ref>
