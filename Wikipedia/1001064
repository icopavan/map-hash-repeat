'''George Edgar Abecassis''' [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (21 March 1913 - 18 December 1991) was an [[England|English]] racing driver, and co-founder of the [[Hersham and Walton Motors|HWM]] [[Formula One]] team.

==Pre-1946 career==
Born in [[Oatlands]], [[Surrey]], Abecassis began circuit racing in 1935 in a modified Austin Seven which became known as ''The Einsitzer''. After taking 1937 as a year away from the track, he acquired an [[Alta Car and Engineering Company|Alta]] and made a name for himself in English national racing during the 1938 and 1939 seasons. In 1939 he won the [[Imperial Trophy]] [[Formula Libre]] race at [[Crystal Palace (circuit)|Crystal Palace]], driving his Alta, defeating [[Birabongse Bhanudej|Prince Bira]], in the E.R.A. known as ''Romulus'', in a wet race,<ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1938, Page 388.</ref> "that being the only time it was beaten by a 1,500 c.c. car in the British Isles." <ref>''Motor Sport'', November 1940, Page 202.</ref>

At one point Abecassis held the Campbell circuit lap record at [[Brooklands]] at 72.61 m.p.h.<ref>''Motor Sport'', May 1939, Page 135.</ref> On July 3, 1938 Abecassis broke the [[Prescott Speed Hill Climb|Prescott Hill Climb]] record with a climb of 47.85 seconds in his supercharged 1½ litre Alta.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1938, Page 246.</ref> 

When [[World War II]] broke out he joined the [[Royal Air Force]] and became an experienced pilot, ultimately becoming a member of the secret "Moon Squadrons",<ref name=gp>{{cite web|title= Drivers: George Abecassis |url= http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/drv-abageo.html |work= GrandPrix.com |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref> ferrying secret agents in and out of occupied countries in Europe with specially-modified Halifax and Stirling aircraft. During the course of his wartime service Abecassis was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].<ref name=watn>{{cite web|title= The World Championship drivers — Where are they now? |url= http://www.oldracingcars.com/driver/George_Abecassis |work= OldRacingCars.com |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</ref>

==Post-1946 career==
{{see also|Hersham and Walton Motors}}
After World War II Abecassis went back to racing, initially with pre-war machinery. He won a race at [[Gransden Lodge Airfield|Gransden Lodge]] in a road-going 3.3-litre Bugatti on June 15, 1946.<ref>''Motor Sport'', July 1946, Page 143.</ref> In 1947 Abecassis finished second in the Swedish Grand Prix, held on a frozen lake at Vallentuna, driving an E.R.A.<ref>''Motor Sport'', April 1947, Page 98.</ref>  In 1948 he finished second to [[Bob Gerard]] in the Jersey International Road Race.<ref>''Motor Sport'', June 1948, cover.</ref> He became a partner, with [[John Heath (driver)|John Heath]], in [[Hersham and Walton Motors]] Ltd., a motor dealership and garage in [[Walton-on-Thames]]. Building on his pre-war association with the Alta marque, Abecassis and HWM assisted in the development of the [[Alta GP]] car,<ref name=watn/> designed to comply with the recently-introduced [[Formula One]] regulations.

After the failure of this enterprise Abecassis and Heath decided to construct their own cars under the HWM banner, but retaining Alta engines. Initially the HWM cars were designed to compete in the [[Formula Two]] class, but when the World Championship switched to Formula Two regulations in {{F1|1952}} HWM cars became eligible to compete in the Grand Prix events. During their prime, HWM employed such future stars as [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Peter Collins (racing driver)|Peter Collins]], and the Belgian [[Johnny Claes]] scored their first victory, in the [[Grand Prix des Frontières]] at [[Chimay]].<ref name=gp/> Abecassis's HWM team also took a notable victory in the [[BRDC International Trophy|International Trophy]] race at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] in 1952, this time with [[Lance Macklin]] at the wheel. With the reintroduction of Formula One cars to the World Championship in {{F1|1954}}, Abecassis and Heath attempted to produce a competitive car using the 2.5-litre version of the Alta engine but it was not a success;<ref name=gp/> HWM cars only contested two further Grand Prix events after 1953.

It was with his own HWM cars that Abecassis raced in his only two Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, at the [[Circuit Bremgarten|Bremgarten]] circuit, in the [[1951 Swiss Grand Prix|1951]] and [[1952 Swiss Grand Prix]]. He was more successful as a sports car driver with [[Aston Martin]] and won his class at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in {{24hLM|1950}}, sharing his [[Aston Martin DB2|DB2]] with Macklin. He also finished second in the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in 1953, partnered by [[Reg Parnell]]. In 1953 Abecassis constructed an HWM sports car for his own personal use, powered by a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] [[straight-6]] engine, with which he successfully contested many national British races until 1956.<ref name=autocourse>{{cite web|title= Driver: Abecassis, George |url= http://www.autocoursegpa.com/driver~driver_id~11549.htm |work= Autocourse Grand Prix Archive |accessdate= 2007-11-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221183618/http://www.autocoursegpa.com/driver~driver_id~11549.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-12-21}}</ref>

In 1956 Heath was killed in an accident in the [[Mille Miglia]] and Abecassis retired from racing, turning his attention to running the HWM operations. He was the [[Facel Vega]] importer for Britain, while his motor industry connections were aided by the fact that he was married to Angela, the daughter of Aston Martin chairman [[David Brown (entrepreneur)|Sir David Brown]]. He died aged 78 in [[Ibstone]], near [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]].

In September 2010 his son David Abecassis is publishing a comprehensive biography of his father under the title 'A Passion for Speed'.
