'''Weis Markets, Inc.''' is a chain of [[supermarket]]s based in [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania]], with a presence in [[Pennsylvania]], [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Maryland]]. In 2012, it operates 161 stores in five states.

==History==
[[File:WeisMarkets footprint.png|250px|thumb|right|Map of Weis stores.]]
Weis Markets was founded as Weis Pure Foods in 1912 in Sunbury, Pennsylvania by two brothers, Harry and Sigmund Weis. Their store has been noted as "revolutionary", as it did not operate on credit—sales were only for cash. At the time, similar stores operated on credit, allowing customers to build a tab that would be paid periodically. Cash sales were a sign of a growing working class earning steady paychecks—and they also helped lower prices by up to 25%.

The second Weis store opened in 1915 in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. Harrisburg would remain an important market for Weis, helping to anchor the central Pennsylvania region that Weis would dominate for decades.

The Weis brothers expanded their chain rapidly, opening dozens of small, in-town grocery stores throughout central Pennsylvania. Their chain peaked at 115 stores in 15 central Pennsylvania counties by 1933. At the time, the modern self-service supermarket was coming into its own. The format was pitted against the traditional model, followed by Weis Pure Foods, in which customers gave their orders to a clerk who would retrieve the requested items. As the modern supermarket model began to take hold, the Weis brothers began to adapt. They closed several corner grocery stores in Harrisburg in 1938, replacing them with their first self-service, consolidated supermarket, which they dubbed the Weis Super Market. Over the next two decades, the company continued with this strategy, and it had consolidated all of its corner grocery stores into supermarkets—35 in total—by 1955.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Weis Markets (as it was known by then) expanded out of its familiar territory, first reaching York and then Lancaster by 1960. The company expanded into adjacent states in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. In 1967, the company ventured outside of Pennsylvania for the first time. It opened stores in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]] and [[Frederick, Maryland]], and it also purchased the six-store [[Albany Public Markets]] chain based in [[Albany, New York]]. Those expansions brought the company to a total of 65 stores. To the west, it expanded to western Pennsylvania, reaching as far west as [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]] and [[Philipsburg, Centre County, Pennsylvania|Philipsburg]], but has since made no efforts to expand farther west. Weis would later shutter the Albany Public Markets chain. A couple were later occupied by [[Grand Union]]. Weis bought at least one former [[King's Department Store|Kings]] location when the company went out in 1984.

Weis's territorial expansions came with mixed results. A company with rural, central Pennsylvania roots, it was able to expand into the [[Baltimore, Maryland]], region with great success, taking on such established players as [[Giant Food of Landover, Maryland|Giant (Landover)]] and [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]]. The company expanded further in Maryland toward Washington, D.C. and Virginia, with much less success. The [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] store (#125) was picketed by union members. It retreated from that market, first closing most of its stores in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], and finally closing its [[Woodbridge, Virginia]] (#125) and [[Manassas, Virginia]] (#136) stores.  By 2006, no stores were left in Virginia. Weis' foray into New Jersey came with mixed results as well, as it was forced to close a new store in Flanders in 2002—only two years after opening it. The three stores currently in New Jersey continue to face stiff competition from Ahold owned Stop & Shop, the [[ShopRite]] cooperative, and, to a lesser extent, [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company|A&P]].

Today, Weis thrives in the rural areas, small towns, and third class cities of northeastern, central, and southern Pennsylvania. It has successfully expanded to the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] markets, and to the [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]]-[[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]] area, but it has been shown less interest in the suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia (though there is a location in nearby [[Lansdale, Pennsylvania|Lansdale]]) and Pittsburgh.

Most recently, Weis Markets is participating in an in-store digital advertising network.<ref>Weis Markets Digital Signage Information</ref>

==Banners==
In addition to the Weis Markets banner, the company once operated supermarkets under the King's and Mr. Z's banners. Those two banners were centered primarily in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley and were acquired in mid-1990s acquisitions. Since their acquisitions, these stores have been remodeled or replaced.  In 2009, they were rebranded to the Weis banner, as was its Cressler's store in Shippensburg.  In 2011, it converted its three Scot's Lo-Cost stores, located in Montoursville, Mill Hall and Coal Township, to the Weis banner.

Weis operates some stores as '''[[Save-a-Lot]]''' under license from Supervalu.  At one time, the company operated a few stores as '''Big-Top Market''', but as of 2006, no more stores exist under this banner.

In 2009, Weis completed the purchase of 11 independently owned "Giant" stores in Broome County, NY. In 2011, it sold or closed its seven remaining SuperPetz units, a move which is expected to enhance the company's overall profitability.

==Competition==
Weis faces significant competition from various food retail formats, including conventional retailers, mass merchant retailers, discount retailers, drug stores, convenience stores, and dollar stores. Weis's chief competition comes in its traditional home base of central Pennsylvania. [[Giant of Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Giant (Carlisle)]], a supermarket chain owned by [[Ahold]], began aggressive expansion during the 1990s, building newer, larger stores with vast selections. The expansion caught Weis off-guard. While Weis was able to kick into gear with an expansion project of its own, it has not yet fully recovered. Giant still remains the market leader throughout central and northeastern Pennsylvania.

Weis faces tough competition in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]] from Giant (Carlisle) and Stauffer's of Kissel Hill.

In Maryland, Weis competes with [[Acme Market|Acme]], Giant Eagle, Safeway, and [[Giant Food of Landover, Maryland|Giant (Landover)]].

In New Jersey, Weis's chief competition includes [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company|A&P]], Giant-Carlisle's sister chain, Stop & Shop, and [[ShopRite]].

In New York, Weis competition includes [[Wegmans]], and [[Price Chopper]].

==Supreme Court Case==
The Weis supermarket in Park Hills Plaza along U.S. Route 220 in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]] was the subject of a key 1960s United States Supreme Court case concerning the "public forum doctrine."  The Court held that a union picket in the supermarket parcel pickup area and parking lot was permissible because the "shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent to the business district" of a city.  Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., 391 U.S. 308 (1968).
==Beer Sales==
Weis Markets is one of the supermarkets in Pennsylvania able to sell beer in in-store cafes at some of its locations. In [[Alcohol laws of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], grocery stores cannot sell beer unless they operate a cafe. As of August 2011, Weis sells beer at 11 locations.
