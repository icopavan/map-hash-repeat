'''Walther Dahl''' (27 March 1916 &ndash; 25 November 1985) was a German [[Oberst]] [[Luftwaffe]] [[fighter ace]] and recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub}}) during [[World War II]]. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grade Oak Leaves was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. A flying ace or fighter ace is a [[military aviation|military aviator]] credited with shooting down five or more enemy [[aircraft]] during aerial combat.<ref>Spick 1996, pp. 3–4.</ref>

==World War II==
Walther Dahl was born in [[Lug, Germany|Lug]] near [[Bad Bergzabern]], son of a teacher who was killed in action in 1918 on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of [[World War I]]. He joined the army in 1935, initially serving in Infantry Regiment 119 in [[Stuttgart]], before transferring to the Luftwaffe and becoming a fighter pilot.

By May 1941 Dahl was part of the ''Geschwaderstab''  of [[Jagdgeschwader 3]] (JG 3) and claimed his first victory on 22 June during the first day of the invasion of Russia. In July Dahl transferred to II. Gruppe of JG 3. By the end of October Dahl had 17 claims. He was then transferred to 4 staffel, JG 3 in December 1941 before the unit was posted to the Mediterranean theatre. He claimed a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] over Malta on 1 April 1942 and on 10 April 1942 Dahl was made ''[[Staffelkapitän]]'', ''Ergänzungsgruppe, JG 3''. 

In April 1943, Dahl was transferred to the staff of the ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]''. In August, Dahl was next appointed ''Geschwaderadjutant,'' JG 3 on the Eastern front where  he had raised his total to 51, being awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold in December 1942 

On 20 July 1943, Dahl was posted as ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' III./JG 3 and relocated to Münster from [[Kursk]] on the Russian Front. He claimed 2 four-engined bombers on 6 September and 2 more four-engined bombers (and a P-38) on 23 February 1944. 

Dahl led a III./JG 3 formation against the Schweinfurt and Regensburg raid of 17 August 1943 but was intercepted by Spitfires of No. 222 Squadron. III./JG 3 lost 5 Bf 109s shot down including Dahl who had to make a belly landing in his Bf 109 G-6.

Major Dahl was awarded the ''Ritterkreuz'' in March 1944 for 67 victories. In May 1944, Dahl was appointed Kommodore of JG z.b.V. He led the unit until 6 June, then taking command of [[JG 300]] on 27 June. JG 300 was to become famous for flying the heavily armed and armored [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Focke Wulf FW 190A-8 "Sturmbock"]] in close formation, driving in their attacks to [[point-blank range]]. As a last resort, after depletion of all ammunition, the pilots had to ram enemy bombers. 

On 7 July 1944 a force of 1,129 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es and [[B-24 Liberator]]s of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) [[Eighth Air Force]] set out from England to bomb aircraft factories in the [[Leipzig]] area and the synthetic oil plants at [[Boehlen]], [[Leuna]]-[[Merseburg]] and Lützkendorf. This formation was intercepted by a German ''Gefechtsverband'' consisting of IV.(Sturm) ''Gruppe'' [[Jagdgeschwader 3]] escorted by two ''Gruppen'' of Bf 109s from [[Jagdgeschwader 300]] led by ''[[Major]]'' Dahl. Dahl drove the attack to point-blank range behind the Liberators of the 492nd Bomb Group before opening fire. 492nd Bomb Group was temporarily without fighter cover. Within about a minute the entire squadron of twelve B-24s had been annihilated. The Germans claimed 28 USAAF [[2nd Air Division]] B-24s that day and were credited with at least 21.<ref>Caldwell & Muller 2007, p. 216.</ref> The majority to the Sturmgruppe attack. IV./JG 3 lost nine fighters shot down and three more suffered damage and made crash landings; five of the unit's pilots were killed.<ref>Dahl 2000, pp. 46&ndash;66</ref><ref>Weal 1996, p. 78.</ref>

[[File:Ellgaard, Ich ramme 1944.jpg|thumb|right|A 1944 drawing by [[Helmuth Ellgaard]] illustrating "ramming"]]
On 13 September, Dahl apparently brought down a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] four-engined bomber by [[Aerial ramming|ramming]] according to his own account. The historians of JG300 (Lorant/Goyat) found no evidence of a corresponding loss in US archives. For his personal exploits and that of his unit, Dahl was dubbed ''Rammdahl'' again according to his own account. On the morning of 30 November 1944, Dahl was informed that [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]] was coming to visit the troops and to present Dahl with the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross. At 12:20 pm Göring and [[Generaloberst]] [[Bruno Loerzer]] arrived and Dahl made a formal report. Soon the discussion came to the question of whether Dahl believed that given these bad weather conditions the ''Geschwader'' could not engage in combat. Dahl explained that in only good conditions would they stand a chance against the overwhelming odds, as they were outnumbered 20:1. He also referred to the inexperience and inadequate training of his young pilots. Into this situation came the news of an approaching bomber formation. Göring ordered Dahl to take off and engage the enemy. Dahl stood his ground and continuously refused to obey. Göring became furious and threatened Dahl with [[court martial]] and execution. Only the arriving ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' [[Adolf Galland]], who confirmed Dahl's opinion, saved Dahl from severe punishment. Nevertheless Dahl was immediately relieved from his command and sent on sick leave. Subsequently Dahl was not presented with the Oak Leaves that day.<ref>Dahl 2000, p. 154-165</ref>

On 26 January 1945, [[Hermann Göring]] appointed him ''Inspekteur der Tagjäger''. Despite his promotion, Dahl continued to fly operationally.

Oberst Dahl ended the war flying the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet fighter with III./[[EJG 2]]. On 27 March 1945, Dahl claimed two [[P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] fighter kills. His 128th and last victory was a USAAF [[P-51 Mustang]] near [[Dillingen]] on 26 April 1945.
 
Dahl claimed some 128 enemy aircraft shot down in 678 missions, including about 300 [[close air support|ground-attack]] missions.<ref>Spick 1996, p. 230.</ref> However the historians of JG 300 (Lorant/Goyat) have identified no more than 100 Dahl claims. Any other figures are likely to have been based on his 'memoir' entitled Rammjäger. Walther Dahl survived the war, and died on 25 November 1985 in [[Heidelberg]] at the age of 69.
