===[[1850-51 Australian cricket season]]===
:{{la|1850-51 Australian cricket season}} â€“ <includeonly>([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/1850-51 Australian cricket season|View AfD]])</includeonly><noinclude>([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2007 March 11#{{anchorencode:1850-51 Australian cricket season}}|View log]])</noinclude>
Not a notable cricket season, article effectively empty.  The matter has been discussed at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Cricket#1877-78 Australian cricket season]].  This AfD is intended to cover all similar articles where no additional information about the season has been included.  It does not cover the [[1977-78 Australian cricket season]] , [[1876-77 Australian cricket season]] , [[1980-81 Australian cricket season]] , [[1932-33 Australian cricket season]], or the [[1928-29 Australian cricket season]] - each of which have had content added and claims to notability.  In the discussion at WikiProject Cricket, it was noted that it should be possible to write a meaningful article when there had been ''a real competition in place: domestic or international. Similarly for tours. The difficulty arises when, as in the 1877-78 Australian cricket season, there was very little domestic competition and no international interest, and is even more problematic for earlier years when there is very little record of anything much "official" happening.''  The template for the articles is at [[Template talk:Australian cricket seasons]] to make it easy for editors to create articles with a similar look and feel.  I believe however that red links are better than effectively empty blue links.  The prod of the [[1876-77 Australian cricket season]] was objected to, hence the escalation to AfD.

::Note - have only had time to tag up too 1879/80 with <nowiki>{{subst:afd1|1850-51 Australian cricket season}}</nowiki> so far - it is a very time consuming process and I have real life pressures.--[[User:Golden Wattle|Golden Wattle ]] <sup>[[User_talk:Golden Wattle|talk]]</sup> 23:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
::Apart from articles mentioned above, also excluded are [[1940-41 to 1944-45 Australian cricket seasons]] and [[1915-16 to 1917-18 Australian cricket seasons]] as being not empty.--[[User:Golden Wattle|Golden Wattle ]] <sup>[[User_talk:Golden Wattle|talk]]</sup> 23:18, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. The argument above seems to me to be incontrovertible, and the user who created these shell articles is no longer contributing, so whatever plans he had for filling these out are now not likely to take place. Golden Wattle has been commendably assiduous in seeking out and listening to the views of [[WikiProject Cricket]] members before putting this note up. [[User:Johnlp|Johnlp]] 23:33, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nominator. &mdash;[[User talk:Moondyne|''Moondyne'']] 23:50, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. However - if someone was willing to do it, the results might be a nice addition to the year in Australia series. --[[User:PDH|Peta]] 00:25, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Though I hate to see a cricket article go, this one is speediable at the moment under [[WP:CSD#Articles|CSD-A3]] as simply a collection of links and a rephrasing of the title. Saying that the 1850-51 season took place in late 1850 and early 1851 does not an article make. [[User:Grutness|Grutness]]...''<small><font color="#008822">[[User_talk:Grutness|wha?]]</font></small>'' 08:57, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Having those seasons as redlinks makes it look as though there was cricket played but noone has written an article yet. The articles should simply state that almost no cricket was played in that year, and why, in order to make things clear to the reader. [[User:Raffles mk|Raffles mk]] 11:06, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' - the case is indeed that "cricket played but noone has written an article yet" not that no cricket was played.  For example the article [[1915-16 to 1917-18 Australian cricket seasons]] states no cricket was played and hence I have excluded it from the debate as I agree that is meaningful information.  The other articles do not clarify if any cricket was played or not - they are actually perhaps misleading--[[User:Golden Wattle|Golden Wattle ]] <sup>[[User_talk:Golden Wattle|talk]]</sup> 20:54, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
**'''Question''' Is there a "master article" that such articles/redlinks could be '''redirected to'''? Maybe the [[Intercolonial cricket in Australia]] article mentioned below? -- [[User:Saberwyn|saberwyn]] 10:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''', I love cricket as much as the next Aussie, but these articles are about as notable as [[1422-23 Australian cricket season]].  [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] 11:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC).
*<small>'''Note''':  This debate has been included in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Cricket|list of Cricket-related deletions]].  </small> <small>-- [[User:Stephen Turner|Stephen Turner]] ([[User talk:Stephen Turner|Talk]]) 11:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</small>
*'''Delete''' all that don't have additional content. They could be made into proper articles, but it would be better for them to be redlinks until that happens. [[User:Stephen Turner|Stephen Turner]] ([[User talk:Stephen Turner|Talk]]) 11:25, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. Might it be a reasonable compromise to '''merge''' all Aussie seasons pre, say, 1877 into one article until such time as there is enough information for separate articles? Or maybe on a by-decade basis? [[User:Grutness|Grutness]]...''<small><font color="#008822">[[User_talk:Grutness|wha?]]</font></small>'' 23:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. See [[Intercolonial cricket in Australia]], which is not an obvious title for non-Australians, but covers some of the ground in a single article. [[User:Johnlp|Johnlp]] 23:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Response to merger proposal''':  Intercolonial cricket is only surely part of the first class cricket story.  I think still delete empty articles not redirect to an article that only partly helps; redirects mask that the info is missing from the wikipedia just as the effectively empty articles do.  There are for some seasons perhaps some great articles waiting to be written.--[[User:Golden Wattle|Golden Wattle ]] <sup>[[User_talk:Golden Wattle|talk]]</sup> 19:01, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' all 19th century articles into one article - [[User:Ozzykhan|Ozzykhan]] 14:37, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. That's a thought. A difficulty is that we're up against, in all of this, our former (and respected) colleague's thought patterns (which aren't necessarily entirely logical, nor necessarily to be followed now that he is gone). The "predecessor" article to [[Intercolonial cricket in Australia]] is, for instance, called [[History of Australian cricket to 1850]], which sounds more like what [[User:Ozzykhan]] wants for the whole 19th century, and which makes sense to me. But [[User:Golden Wattle]]'s point, which I agree with, is, I think, that we have a host of articles here that have no content that is worth merging into anything. [[User:Johnlp|Johnlp]] 01:57, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' only those lacking content.  Most do not state anything other than "The 18XX-YY Australian cricket season took place in late 18XX and early 18YY).  It is better to have the articles redlinked so that someone will (properly) create them rather than having them as redirects.  -- [[User:Black Falcon|Black Falcon]] 04:04, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''To the closing admin.'''  I have compiled the list of the 124 articles that lack content (as of about 10 minutes prior to this post) and are therefore covered in this AFD.  This should make it easier to delete the appropriate ones and leave the rest (note: I have not tagged them all with subst:{{tl|afd1}}).  -- [[User:Black Falcon|Black Falcon]] 04:35, 17 March 2007 (UTC)
