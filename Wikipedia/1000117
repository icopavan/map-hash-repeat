'''Phono-semantic matching''' (PSM) is a linguistic term referring to camouflaged borrowing in which a foreign [[word]] is matched with a [[Phonetics|phonetically]] and [[semantic]]ally similar pre-existent native word/root. 

It may alternatively be defined as the entry of a multisourced neologism that preserves both the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] and the approximate [[sound]] of the parallel expression in the source [[language]], using pre-existent words/roots of the target language. 

Phono-semantic matching is distinct from [[calquing]]. While [[calquing]] includes ([[semantic]]) [[translation]], it does not consist of [[phonetic]] matching (i.e. retaining the approximate [[sound]] of the [[loanword|borrowed]] [[word]] through matching it with a similar-sounding pre-existent [[word]]/[[morpheme]] in the [[target language]]). Phono-semantic matching is also distinct from [[homophonic translation]], which retains only the sound, and not the semantics.

==History==
The term "phono-semantic matching" was introduced by [[Israel]]i linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]].<ref name="palgrave.com">{{cite book |last= Zuckermann |first= Ghil'ad |title= Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Palgrave
Macmillan |year= 2003 |isbn= 140391723X }}</ref> It challenged [[Einar Haugen]]'s classic [[Morphological typology|typology]] of [[loanwords|lexical borrowing]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haugen |first=Einar |year=1950 |title=The Analysis of Linguistic Borrowing |journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]] |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=210–231 |jstor=410058 }}</ref> While Haugen categorized [[loanword|borrowing]] into either substitution or importation, camouflaged borrowing in the form of PSM is a case of "simultaneous substitution and importation." Zuckermann proposed a new classification of multisourced neologisms, words deriving from two or more sources at the same time. Examples of such mechanisms are phonetic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phono-semantic matching. 

Zuckermann concludes that [[language planning|language planners]], for example members of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], employ the very same techniques used in [[folk etymology]] by [[laymen]], as well as by religious leaders.<ref>[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]] (2006), "'Etymythological Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective", ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'', edited by Tope Omoniyi and Joshua A. Fishman, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237-258.</ref> He urges [[lexicographer]]s and [[etymologist]]s to recognize the widespread phenomena of camouflaged borrowing and multisourced neologization and not to force one source on multi-parental [[lexical item]]s.

==Examples==
===Modern Hebrew===
Often in phono-semantic matching, "the [[translation|source-language]] not only dictates the choice of root, but also the choice of noun-pattern, thus constituting a camouflaged influence on the [[translation|target-language]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. For example, the phono-semantic matcher of [[English language|English]] ''dock'' with [[Modern Hebrew|Israeli]] מבדוק ''mivdók'' could have used — after deliberately choosing the phonetically and semantically suitable root בדק (bdq) meaning 'check' (Rabbinic) or 'repair' (Biblical) — the noun-patterns ''mi⌂⌂a⌂á'', ''ma⌂⌂e⌂á'', ''mi⌂⌂é⌂et'', ''mi⌂⌂a⌂áim'' etc. (each ⌂ represents a slot where a radical is inserted). Instead, ''mi⌂⌂ó⌂'', which was not highly productive, was chosen because its [o] makes the final syllable of מבדוק ''mivdók'' sound like English ''dock''."<ref>Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2009), [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf "Hybridity versus Revivability: Multiple Causation, Forms and Patterns"], ''Journal of Language Contact'', Varia 2:40-67, p. 59.</ref>

===Mandarin Chinese===
PSM is frequently used in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] borrowings.<ref>See {{cite journal |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |title=Language Contact and Globalisation: The Camouflaged Influence of English on the World’s Languages – with special attention to Israeli (sic) and Mandarin |journal=Cambridge Review of International Affairs |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=287–307 |doi=10.1080/09557570302045 }} As well as {{cite journal |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2004 |title=Cultural Hybridity: Multisourced Neologization in 'Reinvented' Languages and in Languages with 'Phono-Logographic' Script |journal=Languages in Contrast |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=281–318 |doi= }}</ref>

An example is the [[Taiwanese Mandarin]] word 威而剛 wēiérgāng (weiergang), which literally means "powerful and hard" and refers to [[Viagra]], the drug for treating [[impotence]] in men, manufactured by [[Pfizer]].<ref name="See p 2003">{{cite book |last= Zuckermann |first= Ghil'ad |title= Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Palgrave
Macmillan |year= 2003 |isbn= 140391723X |page= 59 }}.</ref>

Another example is the Mandarin form of [[World Wide Web]], which is ''wàn wéi wǎng'' ({{lang|zh|[[wikt:万维网|万维网]]}}), which satisfies "www" and literally means “myriad dimensional net”.<ref>See [[CEDICT]] or the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=translate&trst=0&trqs=World+Wide+Web&trlang=&wddmtm=0 MDBG Chinese-English Dictionary].</ref> The English word ''[[hacker (term)|hacker]]'' has been borrowed into Mandarin as {{lang|zh|{{linktext|黑客}}}} (''hēikè'', "wicked visitor").<ref>Gao, Liwei (2008). Language change in progress: evidence from computer-mediated communication. Talk given at ''20th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics''.</ref>

"Modern Standard Chinese 声纳 ''shēngnà'' "sonar", which uses the characters 声 ''shēng'' "sound" and 纳 ''nà'' "receive, accept". 声 ''shēng'' is a phonetically imperfect rendering of the English initial syllable (although ''peng'', for instance, would have been much worse). Chinese has a large number of homo/heterotonal homophonous morphemes, which would have been much better phonetically (but not nearly as good semantically) – consider SONG (cf. 送 ''sòng'' ‘deliver, carry, give (as a present)’, 松 ''sōng'' ‘pine; loose, slack’, 耸 ''sǒng'' ‘tower; alarm, attract’ etc.), SOU (cf. 搜 ''sōu'' ‘search’, 叟 ''sŏu'' ‘old man’, 馊 ''sōu'' ‘sour, spoiled’ and many others) or SHOU (cf. 收 ''shōu'' ‘receive, accept’, 受 ''shòu'' ‘receive, accept’, 手 ''shǒu'' ‘hand’, 首 ''shǒu'' ‘head’, 兽 ''shòu'' ‘beast’, 瘦 ''shòu'' ‘thin’ and so forth)."<ref>{{cite book |last= Zuckermann |first= Ghil'ad |title= Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Palgrave
Macmillan |year= 2003 |isbn= 140391723X |page= 57 }}.</ref>

According to Zuckermann, PSM in Mandarin is common in (1) brand names, (2) computer jargon, (3) technological terms, and (4) toponyms. From a monolingual Chinese view, Mandarin PSM is the ‘lesser evil’ compared with Latin script (in writing) or code switching (in speech). Zuckermann’s exploration of PSM in [[Standard Chinese]] and [[Meiji period]] [[Japanese language|Japanese]] concludes that the [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing system]] is multifunctional: '''pleremic''' ("full" of meaning, e.g. [[logographic]]), '''cenemic''' ("empty" of [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], e.g. phonographic - like a [[syllabary]]) and simultaneously cenemic and pleremic ('''phono-logographic'''). Zuckermann argues that [[Leonard Bloomfield]]’s assertion that "a language is the same no matter what system of writing may be used"<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard (1933), ''Language'', New York: Henry Holt, p. 21.</ref> is inaccurate. “If [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] had been written using [[roman letters]], thousands of [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] words would not have been coined, or would have been coined with completely different forms”.<ref>{{cite book |last= Zuckermann |first= Ghil'ad |title= Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Palgrave
Macmillan |year= 2003 |isbn= 140391723X |page= 255}}</ref>

===Japanese===
{{main|Ateji}}

In modern Japanese, loan words are generally represented phonetically via [[katakana]]. However, previously loan words were often represented by Chinese characters, a process called ''[[ateji]]'' (when used for sound, or ''[[jukujikun]],'' when used for meaning), and some of these continue to be used. The characters chosen may correspond to the sound, the meaning, or both.

In many cases the characters used were used only for sound or only for meaning. For example, in the word 寿司 (sushi), the two characters are respectively read as ''su'' and ''shi'', but the character 寿 means "one's natural life span" and 司 means "to administer", neither of which has anything to do with the food – this is ''ateji''. Conversely, in the word 煙草 (''tabako'') for "tobacco", the individual kanji respectively mean "smoke" and "herb", which corresponds to the meaning, but they have no phonetic relationship to the word ''tabako'' – this is 熟字訓 (''[[jukujikun]]'').

In some cases, however, the kanji are sometimes chosen for both their semantic and phonetic values, a form of phono-semantic matching. A stock example is 倶楽部 (''kurabu'') for "[[club]]", where the characters can be interpreted loosely in sequence as "together", "fun" and "place". Another example is 合羽 (''kappa'') for the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''capa'', a kind of [[raincoat]]. The characters can mean "wings coming together", as the pointed ''capa'' resembles a bird with wings folded together.

===Icelandic===
Sapir and Zuckermann (2008) demonstrate how Icelandic camouflages many English words by means of phono-semantic matching.<ref>[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/icelandicPSM.pdf Sapir, Yair and Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2008), "Icelandic: Phonosemantic Matching"], in Judith Rosenhouse and Rotem Kowner (eds), ''Globally Speaking: Motives for Adopting English Vocabulary in Other Languages'', Clevedon-Buffalo-Toronto: Multilingual Matters, pp. 19-43 (Chapter 2).</ref> For example, the Icelandic-looking word ''eyðni'', meaning "AIDS", is a PSM of the English acronym ''AIDS'', using the pre-existent Icelandic verb ''eyða'', meaning "to destroy", and the Icelandic nominal suffix ''-ni''.<ref>See pp. 28-29 of Sapir and Zuckermann (2008 above; cf. 爱滋病 aìzībìng (lit. "a disease caused by (making) love"), another PSM of ''AIDS'', in this case in Modern Standard Chinese - see p. 36 of the same article.</ref> Similarly, the Icelandic word ''tækni'', meaning "technology, technique", derives from ''tæki'', meaning "tool", combined with the nominal suffix ''-ni'', but is, in fact, a PSM of the Danish (or international) ''teknik'', meaning "technology, technique". This neologism was coined in 1912 by Dr Björn Bjarnarson from Viðfjörður in the East of Iceland. It had been little in use until the 1940s, but has ever since become highly common, as a lexeme and as an element in new formations, such as ''raftækni'', lit. "electrical technics", i.e. "electronics", ''tæknilegur'' "technical" and ''tæknir'' "technician".<ref>See pp. 37-38 of Sapir and Zuckermann (2008) above; cf. تقنيّ taqni/tiqani (lit. "of perfection, related to mastering and improving"), meaning "technical, technological", another PSM of the international word ''technical'', in this case in Modern Arabic - see p. 38 of the same article.</ref> Other PSMs discussed in the article are ''beygla'', ''bifra'' – ''bifrari'', ''brokkál'', ''dapur'' – ''dapurleiki'' - ''depurð'', ''fjárfesta'' - ''fjárfesting'', ''heila'', ''guðspjall'', ''ímynd'', ''júgurð'', ''korréttur'', ''Létt og laggott'', ''musl'', ''pallborð'' – ''pallborðsumræður'', ''páfagaukur'', ''ratsjá'', ''setur'', ''staða'', ''staðall'' – ''staðla'' - ''stöðlun'', ''toga'' – ''togari'', ''uppi'' and ''veira''.

===Turkish===
"Perhaps the most famous [[Turkish language|Turkish]] PSM is the one whose current form is ''okul'' "school". It was created to replace Ottoman Turkish ''mektep'', an old loanword from [[Arabic]]. Turkish ''okul'' was obviously based on French ''école'' "school" and might have been influenced by Latin ''schola'' "school" (cf. the original Turkish coinage ''okula(ğ)''). On the other hand, the autochthonous co-etymon of ''okul'' is Turkish ''oku-'' "(to) read", cf. ''okumak'' ‘to read, study’, ''okuma'' ‘reading’, ''okur'' ‘reader’. Note the semantic affinity with Arabic كتب ''kataba'' ‘wrote (masculine, singular)’, the ultimate origin of Ottoman Turkish ''mektep''. However, synchronically, Turkish ''okul'' cannot be regarded as ''öztürkçe'' (pure Turkish) since the final ''-l'' is not a Turkish suffix and was imported ad hoc from French. One might claim that the ''-l'' is the result of analogy to Turkish words ending in ''l'', e.g. ''kızıl'' "red, ruddy", from ''kızmak'' "to get angry/hot". There was also a suggestion that the suffix is in fact the Turkic ''-ul''. However, adding the suffix ''-ul'' to ''oku'' would have yielded ''*okuyul'' (cf. Lewis 1999: 118). Diachronically, however, the original form of ''okul'' was allegedly ''okula'', in which ''-la'' might be explained by analogy to (Ottoman) Turkish ''kışla'' "barracks, winter quarters" (cf. ''kış'' "winter") and ''yayla'' "summer pasture" (cf. ''yaz'' "summer"), although these two are not verb-based (ibid.: 117). Refet, the Deputy for the city of Urfa, falsely suggested that ''okula'' already existed in the Urfa dialect (ibid.: 118, cf. Heyd 1954: 91). Indeed, purists are likely to apply the method of revitalizing and standardizing dialectal words. However, in the case of ''okul'', such an explanation seems to be no more than a [[folk etymology]]. Turkish ''okul'' constitutes a successful creational PSM. As Lewis (1982: vi, reprint of 1953) puts it: "Nothing is to be gained by adopting the ostrich-attitude and saying: ‘Okul (‘school’) is a ridiculous hybrid, out of the Turkish oku- ‘to read’, by the French école. We shall ignore it and continue to use the good old Ottoman word mektep.’ Turkish children nowadays don’t go to mektep; they go to okul."<ref>{{cite book |last= Zuckermann |first= Ghil'ad |title= Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher= Palgrave

Beginning in [[Arabic]] الخرشوف ('al-xarshūf) "the artichoke", it was adapted into Spanish Arabic ''alxarshofa'', then [[Old Spanish]] ''alcarchofa'', then [[Italian language|Italian]] ''alcarcioffo'', North Italian ''arcicioffo'' > ''arciciocco'' > ''articiocco'', then as the [[internationalism (linguistics)|internationalism]] phonetically realised in English as ''artichoke''. The word was eventually ''phono-semantically matched'' back into [[Arabic]] (for example in [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and Israel) as أرضي شوكي ''arḍī shōkī'', consisting of أرضي ''arḍī'' "earthly" and شوكي ''shawkī'' "thorny".

===Brand names===
''Viagra'', which was suggested by Interbrand Wood (the consultancy firm hired by Pfizer), is itself a multisourced neologism, based on [[Sanskrit]] ''व्याघ्र'' ''vyāghráh'' "tiger" but enhanced by the words ''vigour'' (i.e. strength) and ''Niagara'' (i.e. free/forceful flow).<ref name="See p 2003"/>

==Motivations for phono-semantic matching==
According to Zuckermann,<ref name="palgrave.com"/> PSM has various advantages from the point of view of the puristic language planner:

* Recycling obsolete lexical items
* Camouflaging foreign influence (for the native speaker in the future)
* Facilitating initial learning ([[mnemonic]]s) (for the contemporary learner/speaker)

Other motivations for PSM include the following:

* Playfulness (cf. midrashic tradition of homiletic commentary, cf. the Jewish ''[[pilpul]]'')
* [[Apollonian]]ism (the wish to create order/meaningfulness, cf. [[folk etymology]], etymythology, [[paronymic attraction]])
* [[Iconicity]] (the belief that there is something intrinsic about the sound of names)
* [[Political correctness]] / rejective lexical engineering
* attracting customers (in the case of [[brand names]])
