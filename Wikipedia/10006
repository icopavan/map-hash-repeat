An '''electronic musical instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] that produces its sounds using [[electronics]]. Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical [[audio signal]] that ultimately drives a [[loudspeaker]].

An electronic instrument may include a [[user interface]] for controlling its sound, often by adjusting the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[frequency]], or duration of each [[note]]. However, it is increasingly common for the user interface and sound-generating functions to be separated into a [[MIDI controller|music controller]] ([[input device]]) and a [[music synthesizer]], respectively, with the two devices communicating through a musical performance description language such as [[MIDI]] or [[Open Sound Control]].

All electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of [[audio signal processing]] applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called [[sound effect]]s; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often hazy.

French [[composer]] and engineer [[Edgard Varèse]] created a variety of compositions using [[electronic horn]]s, whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote [[Poème électronique|Poème Électronique]] for the Phillips pavilion at the [[Expo '58|Brussels World Fair]] in 1958. 

Electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. The development of new electronic musical instruments, controllers, and synthesizers continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on [[New interfaces for musical expression]], have organized to report cutting edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments, controllers, and synthesizers.

== Early electronic musical instruments ==
=== Emergence of electronic sound technology ===
[[Image:Clavessin electrique.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the clavecin électrique]]
In the 18th-century, musicians and composers adapted a number of acoustic instruments to exploit the novelty of electricity. Thus, in the broadest sense, the first electrified musical instrument was the [[Denis d'or]], dating from 1753, followed shortly by the [[Clavecin électrique]] by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in 1761. The former instrument consisted of a keyboard instrument of over 700 strings, electrified temporarily to enhance sonic qualities. The latter was a keyboard instrument with [[plectrum|plectra]] (picks) activated electrically. However, neither instrument used electricity as a sound-source.

The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by [[Elisha Gray]].<ref name="elisha">{{Citation

}}</ref> The "Musical Telegraph" was a chance by-product of his telephone technology when Gray accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self-vibrating electromagnetic circuit and so invented a basic [[oscillator]]. The Musical Telegraph used steel reeds oscillated by electromagnets and transmitted over a telephone line. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device into later models, which consisted of a diaphragm vibrating in a magnetic field.

A significant invention, which later had a profound effect on electronic music, was [[Lee DeForest]]'s triode [[Audion tube|audition]]. This was the first thermionic valve, or [[vacuum tube]], invented in 1906, which led to the generation and amplification of electrical signals, radio broadcasting, and electronic computation, amongst other things.

Other early synthesizers included [[Thaddeus Cahill]]'s [[Dynamophone]] or Telharmononium (before 1907), Jorg Mager's Spherophone (1924) and Partiturophone, the [[Theremin]] (1927), which was marketed by RCA, Taubmann's similar Electronde (1933), the Ondes Martenot (1928), Trautwein's [[Trautonium]] (1930). The '''Mellertion''' (1933) used a non-standard scale, Bertrand's Dynaphone could produce octaves and perfect fifths, while the '''Emicon''' was an American, keyboard-controlled instrument constructed in 1930 and the German '''Hellertion''' combined four instruments to produce chords. Three Russian instruments also appeared, Oubouhof's [[Croix Sonore]] (1934),  [[Ivor Darreg]]'s [[microtonal music|microtonal]] 'Electronic Keyboard Oboe' (1937) and the [[ANS synthesizer]], constructed by the Russian scientist [[Evgeny Murzin]] from 1937 to 1958. Only two models of this latter were built and the only surviving example is currently stored at the Lomonosov University in [[Moscow]]. It has been used in many Russian movies - like ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' - to produce unusual, "cosmic" sounds.<ref>{{Citation

=== Telharmonium ===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;">
[[Image:Teleharmonium1897.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Telharmonium console <br/>by [[Thaddeus Cahill]] 1897]]</div>
{{main|Telharmonium}}
In 1897 [[Thaddeus Cahill]] patented an instrument called the Telharmonium (or Teleharmonium, also known as the Dynamaphone). Using [[tonewheel]]s to generate musical sounds as electrical signals by [[additive synthesis]], it was capable of producing any combination of notes and overtones, at any dynamic level. This technology was later used to design the [[Hammond organ]]. Between 1901 and 1910 Cahill had three progressively larger and more complex versions made, the first weighing seven tons, the last in excess of 200 tons. Portability was managed only by rail and with the use of thirty boxcars. By 1912, public interest had waned, and Cahill's enterprise was bankrupt.<ref>Weidenaar 1995.</ref>

=== Theremin ===

{{main|Theremin}}
Another development, which aroused the interest of many composers, occurred in 1919-1920. In Leningrad, Leon Theremin (actually [[Lev Termen]]) built and demonstrated his Etherophone, which was later renamed the [[Theremin]]. This led to the first compositions for electronic instruments, as opposed to noisemakers and re-purposed machines.

Composers who ultimately utilized the Theremin included [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse]]&mdash;in his piece ''Ecuatorial'' (1934)&mdash;while conductor [[Leopold Stokowski]] experimented with its use in arrangements from the classical repertory.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}
In 1929, [[Joseph Schillinger]] composed ''First Airphonic Suite for Theremin and Orchestra'', premièred with the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] with [[Leon Theremin]] as soloist. The next year [[Henry Cowell]] commissioned Theremin to create the first electronic rhythm machine, called the [[Rhythmicon]]. Cowell wrote some compositions for it, and he and Schillinger premiered it in 1932.

=== Ondes Martenot ===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;">
[[Image:Ondes martenot.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Ondes Martenot (ca.1974, <br/>7th generation model)]]</div>
{{main|Ondes Martenot}}
The 1920s have been called the apex of the Mechanical Age and the dawning of the Electrical Age. In 1922, in Paris, [[Darius Milhaud]] began experiments with "vocal transformation by phonograph speed change."<ref name = "tvnpyt">Russcol 1972, 68.</ref> These continued until 1927.

This decade brought a wealth of early electronic instruments&mdash;along with the Theremin, there is the presentation of the [[Ondes Martenot]], which was designed to reproduce the microtonal sounds found in Hindu music, and the [[Trautonium]].
Maurice Martenot invented the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and soon demonstrated it in Paris. Composers using the instrument ultimately include [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]], [[Arthur Honegger|Honneger]], [[André Jolivet|Jolivet]], [[Charles Koechlin|Koechlin]], [[Olivier Messiaen|Messiaen]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], [[Gilles Tremblay|Tremblay]], and [[Edgard Varèse|Varèse]]. [[Radiohead]] guitarist and multi-instrumentalist [[Jonny Greenwood]] also uses it in his compositions and a plethora of Radiohead songs. In 1937, Messiaen wrote ''Fête des belles eaux'' for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in ''[[Trois petites Liturgies de la Présence Divine]]'' (1943&ndash;44) and the ''[[Turangalîla-Symphonie]]'' (1946&ndash;48/90).

=== Trautonium ===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;">
[[Image:Volkstrautonium MIM.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Volks Trautonium (1933, Telefunken Ela T 42)]]</div>
{{main|Trautonium}}
The Trautonium was invented in 1928. It was based on the [[subharmonic]] scale, and the resulting sounds were often used to emulate bell or gong sounds, as in the 1950s Bayreuth productions of ''[[Parsifal]]''. In 1942, Richard Strauss used it for the bell- and gong-part in the Dresden première of his ''Japanese Festival Music''.  This new class of instruments, microtonal by nature, was only adopted slowly by composers at first, but by the early 1930s there was a burst of new works incorporating these and other electronic instruments.

=== Hammond organ and Novachord ===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;">
[[Image:Novachord frontS.jpg|thumb|center|160px|Hammond Novachord (1939)]]</div>
{{main|Hammond organ|Novachord}}
In 1929 [[Laurens Hammond]] established his company for the manufacture of electronic instruments. He went on to produce the [[Hammond organ]], which was based on the principles of the [[Telharmonium]], along with other developments including early reverberation units.<ref>Russcol 1972, 70.</ref>

The first commercially-manufactured synthesizer was the [[Novachord]], built by the [[Hammond Organ]] Company from 1938 to 1942, which offered 72-note [[Polyphony (instrument)|polyphony]] using 12 oscillators driving [[monostable]]-based divide-down circuits, basic [[envelope generator|envelope]] control and resonant [[low-pass filter]]s. The instrument featured 163 vacuum tubes and weighed 500 pounds. The instrument's use of envelope control is significant, since this is perhaps the most significant distinction between the modern synthesizer and other electronic instruments.<br clear="right"/>

{{Main|Analog synthesizer|Synthesizer}}

The most commonly used electronic instruments are [[synthesizer]]s, so-called because they artificially generate sound using a variety of techniques. All early circuit-based synthesis involved the use of analogue circuitry, particularly voltage controlled amplifiers, oscillators and filters. An important technological development was the invention of the [[Clavivox]] [[synthesizer]] in 1956 by [[Raymond Scott]] with subassembly by [[Robert Moog]].

=== Modular synthesizers ===
{{main|Modular synthesizer}}
[[RCA]] produced experimental devices to synthesize voice and music in the 1950s.  The [[RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer|Mark II Music Synthesizer]], housed at the [[Computer Music Center|Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center]] in [[New York City]]. Designed by Herbert Belar and Harry Olson at RCA, with contributions from Vladimir Ussachevsky and Peter Mauzey, it was installed at Columbia University in 1957. Consisting of a room-sized array of interconnected sound synthesis components, it was only capable of producing music by programming,<ref name="beginnings"/> using a [[paper tape]] [[Music sequencer|sequencer]] punched with holes to control pitch sources and filters, similar to a mechanical [[player piano]] but capable of generating a wide variety of sounds. The [[vacuum tube]] system had to be patched to create timbres.

[[Image:Bob Moog3.jpg|thumb|left|Robert Moog]]
In the 1960s synthesizers were still usually confined to studios due to their size. They were usually modular in design, their stand-alone signal sources and processors connected with patch cords or by other means and controlled by a common controlling device. [[Harald Bode]], [[Don Buchla]], [[Hugh Le Caine]], [[Raymond Scott]] and [[Paul Ketoff]] were among the first to build such instruments, in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Buchla later produced a commercial modular synthesizer, the [[Buchla|Buchla Music Easel]].<ref>{{Citation

Moog established standards for control interfacing, using a logarithmic 1-volt-per-octave for pitch control and a separate triggering signal. This standardization allowed synthesizers from different manufacturers to operate simultaneously. Pitch control was usually performed either with an organ-style keyboard or a [[music sequencer]] producing a timed series of control voltages. During the late 1960s hundreds of popular recordings used Moog synthesizers. Other early commercial synthesizer manufacturers included [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]], who also started with modular synthesizers before producing all-in-one instruments, and British firm [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]].

===Integrated synthesizers===

In 1970, Moog designed the [[Minimoog]], a non-modular synthesizer with a built-in keyboard. The analogue circuits were interconnected with switches in a simplified arrangement called "normalization." Though less flexible than a modular design, normalization made the instrument more portable and easier to use. The [[Minimoog]] sold 12,000 units.<ref>{{Citation

It has become celebrated for its "fat" sound - and its tuning problems. Miniaturized solid-state components allowed synthesizers to become self-contained, portable instruments that soon began to be used in live performance and quickly became  the most widely used synthesizer in both popular and electronic art music.<ref name="montanaro">{{cite web

===Polyphony===
{{main|Polyphony (instrument)#Synthesizer}}
Many early analog synthesizers were monophonic, producing only one tone at a time. Popular monophonic synthesizers include the Moog [[Minimoog]], and [[Roland SH-101]]. A few, such as the Moog Sonic Six, [[ARP Odyssey]] and EML 101, could produce two different pitches at a time when two keys were pressed.  [[Polyphony (instrument)|Polyphony]] (multiple simultaneous tones, which enables [[Chord (music)|chords]]) was only obtainable with electronic organ designs at first. Popular electronic keyboards combining organ circuits with synthesizer processing included the ARP Omni and Moog's Polymoog and Opus 3.

By 1976 affordable polyphonic synthesizers began to appear, notably the Yamaha CS-50, CS-60 and [[Yamaha CS-80|CS-80]], the [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]] and the [[Oberheim]] Four-Voice. These remained complex, heavy and relatively costly. The recording of settings in digital memory allowed storage and recall of sounds. The first practical polyphonic synth, and the first to use a microprocessor as a controller, was the [[Sequential Circuits]] [[Prophet-5]] introduced in late 1977.<ref>{{Citation

{{main|Magnetophon|Musique concrète|Multitrack recording|Chamberlin|Mellotron}}
In 1935, another significant development was made in Germany. Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (AEG) demonstrated the first commercially produced [[magnetic tape recorder]], called the "[[Magnetophon]]".  [[Magnetic tape sound recording|Audio tape]], which had the advantage of being fairly light as well as having good audio fidelity, ultimately replaced the bulkier wire recorders.

The term "electronic music" (which first came into use during the 1930s) came to include the tape recorder as an essential element: "electronically produced sounds recorded on tape and arranged by the composer to form a musical composition")<ref>"Electronic music": [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/electronic%20music Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, Inc.]  (accessed: August 19, 2007)</ref> It was also indispensable to [[Musique concrète]].

Tape also gave rise to the first, analogue, sample-playback keyboards, the [[Chamberlin]] and its more famous successor the [[Mellotron]], an electro-mechanical, polyphonic keyboard originally developed and built in Birmingham, England in the early 1960s.

{{main|circuit bending}}
It was within this period (1966&ndash;67) that [[Reed Ghazala]] discovered and began to teach "[[circuit bending]]"&mdash;the application of the creative short circuit, a process of chance short-circuiting, creating experimental electronic instruments, exploring sonic elements mainly of timbre and with less regard to pitch or rhythm, and influenced by [[John Cage]]’s [[aleatoric music]] concept.<ref name="circuit">{{cite web

Much of this manipulation of circuits directly, especially to the point of destruction, was pioneered by [[Louis and Bebe Barron]] in the early 1950s, such as their work with [[John Cage]] on the ''[[Williams Mix]]'' and especially in the soundtrack to [[Forbidden Planet]].

The first [[digital synthesizer]]s were academic experiments in sound synthesis using digital computers. [[FM synthesis]] was developed for this purpose, as a way of generating complex sounds digitally with the smallest number of computational operations per sound sample. In 1983 [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] introduced the first stand-alone digital synthesizer, the [[DX-7]]. It used frequency modulation synthesis (FM synthesis), first developed by [[John Chowning]] at [[Stanford University]] during the late sixties.<ref>Chowning, 1973</ref> Chowning exclusively licensed his [[FM synthesis]] patent to Yamaha in 1975.<ref>{{Citation

{{main|computer music|Software synthesizer}}
An important new development was the advent of computers for the purpose of composing music, as opposed to manipulating or creating sounds. [[Iannis Xenakis]] began what is called "musique stochastique," or "[[stochastic music]]", which is a method of composing that employs mathematical probability systems. Different probability algorithms were used to create a piece under a set of parameters. Xenakis used graph paper and a ruler to aid in calculating the velocity trajectories of [[glissando|glissandi]] for his orchestral composition ''Metastasis'' (1953&ndash;54), but later turned to the use of computers to compose pieces like ''ST/4'' for string quartet and ''ST/48'' for orchestra (both 1962). 

The impact of computers continued in 1956. [[Lejaren Hiller]] and [[Leonard Isaacson]] composed ''Iliac Suite'' for [[string quartet]], the first complete work of computer-assisted composition using [[algorithm]]ic composition.<ref>Schwartz 1975, 347.</ref> 

In 1957, [[Max Mathews]] at [[Bell Lab]] wrote [[MUSIC-N]] series, a first computer program family for generating digital audio waveforms through direct synthesis.  Then [[Barry Vercoe]] wrote [[MUSIC-N|MUSIC 11]] based on [[Music 4|MUSIC IV-BF]], a next-generation music synthesis program (later evolving into [[csound]], which is still widely used).

In mid 80s, [[Miller Puckette]] at [[IRCAM]] developed graphic signal-processing software for [[Sogitec 4X|4X]] called [[Max (software)|Max]] (after [[Max Mathews]]), and later ported it to [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] (with [[Dave Zicarelli]] extending it for [[Opcode Systems|Opcode]] <ref>[http://www.atpm.com/6.05/barline.shtml Max at Opcode]</ref>) for real-time [[MIDI]] control, bringing algorithmic composition availability to most composers with modest computer programming background.

=== MIDI ===
[[Image:Midiaansl.jpg|thumb|MIDI, a LAN for music, enables connections between digital musical instruments]]
{{main|Musical Instrument Digital Interface}}
In 1980, a group of musicians and music merchants met to standardize an interface by which new instruments could communicate control instructions with other instruments and the prevalent microcomputer. This standard was dubbed MIDI ([[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]]). A paper was authored by [[Dave Smith (engineer)|Dave Smith]] of [[Sequential Circuits]] and proposed to the [[Audio Engineering Society]] in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.

The advent of MIDI technology allows a single keystroke, control wheel motion, pedal movement, or command from a microcomputer to activate every device in the studio remotely and in synchrony, with each device responding according to conditions predetermined by the composer.

MIDI instruments and software made powerful control of sophisticated instruments easily affordable by many studios and individuals. Acoustic sounds became reintegrated into studios via [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and sampled-ROM-based instruments.

The increasing power and decreasing cost of sound-generating electronics (and especially of the personal computer), combined with the standardization of the [[MIDI]] and [[Open Sound Control]] musical performance description languages, has facilitated the separation of musical instruments into music controllers and music synthesizers.

By far the most common musical controller is the [[musical keyboard]]. Other controllers include the [[radiodrum]], Akai's [[EWI]], the guitar-like [[SynthAxe]], the [http://www.synthzone.com/bsynth.html BodySynth], the [[Buchla Thunder]], the [[Continuum (instrument)|Continuum Fingerboard]], the [[Roland Octapad]], various [[isomorphic keyboards]] including the [[Thummer]], and [[Kaossilator|Kaossilator Pro]], and kits like [[I-CubeX]].

===The reactable===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;margin:0 0 -3.3ex 0;">
[[Image:Reactable Multitouch.jpg|thumb|160px|Reactable]]</div>
{{main|reactable}}
The reactable is a round translucent table, used in a darkened room, and appears as a [[backlight|backlit]] display. By placing blocks called ''tangibles'' on the table, and interfacing with the visual display via the tangibles or fingertips, a [[Virtuality|virtual]] [[modular synthesizer]] is operated, creating music or sound effects.

===Percussa AudioCubes===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;margin:0 0 -3.3ex 0;">
[[Image:Detailed view of Audiocubes.jpg|thumb|160px|Audiocubes]]</div>
{{main|audiocubes}}
AudioCubes are autonomous wireless cubes powered by an internal computer system and rechargeable battery. They have internal RGB lighting, and are capable of detecting each other's location, orientation and distance. The cubes can also detect distances to the user's hands and fingers. Through interaction with the cubes, a variety of music and sound software can be operated. AudioCubes have applications in sound design, music production, DJing and live performance.

===Kaossilator===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;margin:0 0 -3.3ex 0;">
[[Image:KORG Kaossilator.jpg|thumb|120px|Korg Kaossilator]]</div>
{{main|Kaossilator}}
The Kaossilator and Kaossilator Pro are compact instruments where the position of a finger on the touch pad controls two note-characteristics; usually the pitch is changed with a left-right motion and the tonal property, filter or other parameter changes with an up-down motion.  The touch pad can be set to different musical scales and keys.  The instrument can record a repeating loop of adjustable length, set to any tempo, and new loops of sound can be layered on top of existing ones.  This lends itself to electronic dance-music but is more limited for controlled sequences of notes, as the pad on a regular Kaossilator is featureless.

===Eigenharp===
{{main|eigenharp}}
The Eigenharp is a large instrument resembling a [[bassoon]], which can be interacted with through touch-sensitive buttons, a drum sequencer and a mouthpiece. The sound processing is done on a separate computer.

===AlphaSphere===
<div style="clear:right;float:right;margin:0 0 -3.3ex 0;">
[[Image:Alphasphere.jpg|thumb|160px|[[AlphaSphere (instrument)|AlphaSphere]]]]</div>
{{main|AlphaSphere (instrument)}}
The AlphaSphere is a spherical instrument that consists of 48 tactile pads that respond to pressure as well as touch. Custom software allows the pads to be indefinitely programmed individually or by groups in terms of function, note, and pressure parameter among many other settings. The primary concept of the instrument is to move electronic musicians away from their computer screens and back to an instrument.

==DIY culture==
===Circuit bending on today===
[[File:Bending.jpg|thumb|160px|Probing for "bends" using a jeweler's screwdriver and alligator clips.]]
{{main|#Hardware hacking|Chiptune}}

[[Circuit bending]] is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low [[voltage]], battery-powered [[guitar effects]], children's [[toy]]s and small digital [[synthesizer]]s to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators. Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with [[noise music]], though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with "bent" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and [[potentiometer]]s that alter the circuit. With the revived interest for analogue synthesizer circuit bending became a cheap solution for many experimental musicians to create their own individual analogue sound generators. Nowadays many schematics can be found to built noise generators such as the [[Atari Punk Console]] or the [[Dub Siren]] as well as simple modifications for children toys such as the famous [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]]s that are often modified by circuit benders.

===Chip music===
{{main|Chiptune}}
{{see also|Video game music}}
[[Chiptune]], chipmusic, or chip music is music written in sound formats where many of the sound textures are synthesized or sequenced in real time by a [[computer]] or [[video game console]] [[sound chip]], sometimes including sample-based synthesis and low bit sample playback. Many chip music devices featured synthesizers in tandem with low rate sample playback.

According to a [http://sixense.com/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=61 forum post] in December 2010, Sixense Entertainment is working on musical control with the [[Sixense TrueMotion]] motion controller.

[[Immersive virtual musical instrument]]s, or [[immersive virtual instrument]]s for music and sound aim to represent musical events and sound parameters in a [[virtual reality]] so that they can be perceived not only through auditory feedback but also visually in 3D and possibly through tactile as well as haptic feedback, allowing the development of novel interaction metaphors beyond manipulation such as prehension.
