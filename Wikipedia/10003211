'''''Syncaris pacifica''''' is an [[endangered species]] of [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[shrimp]] in the family [[Atyidae]] that occurs only in a limited [[range (biology)|range]] within the northern [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[California]], [[United States|USA]]. Specifically, this [[species]] occurs only in 17 [[stream]] segments within [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]], [[Napa County, California|Napa]] and [[Marin County, California|Marin Counties]]. This species is often [[translucent]] to transparent, with both [[sex]]es capable of considerable [[color]]ation altering, as a sophisticated form of [[camouflage]].<ref name=USFW>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/sacramento/es/animal_spp_acct/california_freshwater_shrimp.htm |publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] Office, Sacramento Division |title=Species account for California freshwater shrimp, ''Syncaris pacifica''}}</ref> This [[Decapoda|decapod]] is commonly known as '''California freshwater shrimp''', and is the only decopod shrimp in California that occurs in non-[[saline water]]s.

''S. pacifica'' is one of only four members of the family Atyidae in [[North America]]. [[Genetics|Genetic]] studies have been conducted to compare specimens of ''Syncaris pacifica'' from various drainages, with the results showing a variety of well-defined genetic variations within these populations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.public.iastate.edu/~kjroe/researchpage.html |author=Kevin J. Roe |title=Systematics, evolution, & conservation: North American Atyid Shrimp}}</ref> The species has a superficial appearance to its better known marine relatives, and may attain a body length of about 5&nbsp;cm.

==Morphology==
[[File:Syncarispacificaone.jpg|right|frame|''Syncaris pacifica'']]
''Syncaris pacifica'' is a ten-legged [[crustacean]] that employs a two-pronged approach to [[camouflage]]: it uses a technique of [[translucent|translucency]] coupled with strategically placed [[chromatophore]]s, which occur internally as well as on the surface. As a result, the clustered color-producing cells combined with translucency masks the body outline and blends the [[organism]] to its subsurface environment.<ref name=USFW/> Consequently an illusion is presented that ''S. pacifica'' are submerged, decaying [[vegetation]]. California freshwater shrimp move quite torpidly and are practically invisible among [[water column]] leaf and twig substrates, and among the slender, exposed, living roots of [[riparian]] [[vegetation]] along undercut stream banks.<ref name="USGS">[http://wfrc.usgs.gov/research/aquatic%20ecology/STSaiki8.htm ''Habitat Requirements of the Endangered California Freshwater Shrimp in Streams on the Point Reyes National Seashore and Golden Gate National Recreational Area''], [[United States Geological Survey]]</ref>

Males and juveniles are always translucent or transparent, while coloration of the sometimes translucent females ranges from dark brown to purple, some with a broad tan [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] band. Females may change rapidly from this very dark [[crypsis|cryptic color]] to nearly transparent with diffuse chromatophores. Moreover, females are typically longer and deeper bodied than males.

All Atyidae family members can be distinguished from other shrimp by their overall length as well as the extent length of their pincer-like claws and manifestation of terminal bristles (setae) at the tips of the first and second [[Chela (organ)|chelae]]. A short spine above the eye and the angled articulation of the second chelae with the [[carpus]] differentiate the California freshwater shrimp from other shrimp that occur California.<ref name=USFW/> A [[carapace]] length (reckoned from eye socket to tail-tip) of slightly more than five centimeters can be attained.

==Range==
[[File:Lagunadesantarosa.jpg|thumb|[[Laguna de Santa Rosa]], the second largest [[wetland]] of [[Northern California]] and [[habitat]] of ''Syncaris pacifica'']]
The precise historic distribution of ''Syncaris pacifica'' is not known, since geologic and climatic changes since the early [[Quaternary|Quaternary Period]] have significantly altered river courses of the [[Northern California]] coast. Historically, ''Syncaris pacifica'' may have occurred as far north as the [[Klamath River]], but reductions of [[habitat]], especially from [[overgrazing]] of cattle, along with chemical [[water pollution]] has greatly diminished the present range to 17 stream segments in Sonoma, Napa and Marin Counties. These habitat stream segments are sometimes separated by degraded portions of a given creek, effectively leading to a [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented population]].  Occurrence is restricted to [[Perennial stream|perennial]] streams below 100 meters above sea level in elevation and of gradient less than one percent.<ref>{{cite book |author=L. L. Eng |year=1981 |title=Distribution, life history, and status of the California freshwater shrimp, ''Syncaris pacifica'' (Holmes) |publisher=[[California Department of Fish and Game]] |id=Inland Fisheries Endangered Species Program Special Publication 81-1}}</ref> The stream segments can be grouped as follows:
* Certain stream segments which drain directly to the [[Pacific Ocean]], including [[Tomales Bay]], in Marin and Sonoma Counties
* [[Sonoma Creek]], lower [[Napa River]], [[Tolay Creek]] and [[Petaluma River]], all of which drain to the [[San Pablo Bay]]
*Certain lower tributaries of the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] including the [[Laguna de Santa Rosa]] and certain of its tributaries such as [[Blucher Creek]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluchercreek.org/shrimp.htm |publisher=Blucher Creek Watershed Council |title=Our Endangered California Freshwater Shrimp}}</ref>

==Habitat and behavior==
[[File:Sonomacreek.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sonoma Creek]], a [[habitat]] of ''Syncaris pacifica'']]

California freshwater shrimp prefer streams that have water flowing year round with predominately low gradient flows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfg.ca.gov/hcpb/cgi-bin/read_one.asp?specy=invertebrates&idNum=3 |publisher=[[California Department of Fish and Game]] |title=California Freshwater Shrimp, ''Syncaris pacifica''}}</ref> In the summer months with little [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and [[surface runoff]] the flow rates can be very low with larger pools but they characteristically transport heavy runoff during the rainy winter season. 

As a slow moving species ''S. pacifica'' feeds on decomposing vegetation and other detritus, consuming minute diverse particles conveyed by currents to downstream pools. As the water slows, the particles are filtered by the fine network of exposed roots from trees, such as from willows and alders. The California freshwater shrimp merely brush up the food with tufts at the tips of their small [[claw]]s, and lift to their mouths the collected morsels.  Colonized by [[alga]]e, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and microscopic animals, the particle agglomerates are quite nutritious. Although most species of shrimp walk slowly about the roots as they feed, ''S. pacitica'' will undertake short swimming bursts to obtain particularly desirable items.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Larry Serpa |year=1996 |title=The California freshwater shrimp: A ghost-like crustacean we can't afford to lose |journal=[[Tidelines]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=1–3 |publisher=[[United States Fish & Wildlife Service]] |url=http://www.fws.gov/desfbay/Archives/shrimp/shrimp.htm}}</ref>

Breeding occurs once per annum during the autumn. Adults attain sexually maturity by the end of their second summer. A female can be expected to generate approximately 50 to 120 eggs per breeding season, which remain attached to the mother for the entire winter.  Studies on other family members suggest a lifespan for this species of several years.<ref>{{cite journal |author=G. Fryer |title=Studies on the functional morphology and ecology of the atyid prawns of Dominica |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] Series B, Biological Sciences |volume=277 |issue=952 |year=1977 |pages=57–129 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1977.0007 |pmid=850693}}</ref>

==Conservation==
''Syncaris pacifica'' and associated native aquatic species
* Protect and manage ''S. pacifica'' populations and habitat once the threats are removed and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]] has been completed
* Monitor and evaluate ''S. pacifica'' habitat conditions and populations
* Assess effectiveness of various [[Conservation biology|conservation]] efforts
* Conduct research on the [[biology]] of the species
* Restore and maintain viable ''S. pacifica'' populations at extirpated locations
* Increase public awareness and involvement in the protection of ''S. pacifica'' and native [[sympatric|cohabiting]] species
* Assess effects of various conservation efforts on cohabiting native species
* Assemble a ''S. pacifica'' recovery team

There are individual efforts occurring in various stream segments, one of the most notable being a [[grassroots]] [[conservation biology|conservation program]] to restore over {{convert|1400|m|sp=us}} of [[Stemple Creek]] by students at Brookside School in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]]. In this case students raised money, lobbied legislators and succeeded in obtaining grant funds to prevent cattle grazing within the creek, one of the greatest habitat threats.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esb/96/shrimp.html |title=A Shrimp Spawns Partnerships |author=Daniel Strait |journal=[[Endangered Species Bulletin]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070509112115/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/esb/96/shrimp.html |archivedate=May 9, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Partnerships for a shrimp |url=http://www.fws.gov/capartners/Shrimp-Club.htm |author=Daniel Strait |date=January 2005 |publisher=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}</ref>

Although a new location of ''Syncaris pacifica'' was found in the 1990s at [[Olema Creek]], the general trend for the population of this organism is decline.  For example, 1999 surveys in Marin County found fewer individuals present than a comparable 1997 survey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krisweb.com/biblio/marinsonoma_nps_fong_2000_99shrimp.pdf |title=1999 Survey for California freshwater shrimp at five Marin County locations|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}</ref>
