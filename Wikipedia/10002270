==History==
===Creation===
The Voodoo Music Festival was first held on October 30, 1999 at [[Tad Gormley Stadium]] in [[City Park (New Orleans)|City Park]]. Planned and executed by Steve Rehage, CEO of Rehage Entertainment, the festival consisted of three stages and many local and national acts.

===Growth===
The Voodoo Festival started with very humble beginnings in 1999 as a one day music festival in Tad Gormley Stadium in New Orleans with an attendance of about 8,000 people, the headlining artist was Wyclef Jean and [[Fugees]]. The following year expanded to 2 days and drew attention with a performance by [[Eminem]], whose fame had exploded just before the festival, bringing Voodoo to the attention of music fans from around the world. In 2006, Voodoo separated the show into 3 distinct areas (Le Ritual, Le Flambeau and Le Carnival) on six stages. Each area was designed to showcase uniquely different sides of the personality of the festival and New Orleans.  “Le Flambeau”  features music and sounds consistent with the hometown style of The Big Easy. “Le Ritual” features more mainstream music we are all familiar with, and finally “Le Carnival” features indie bands, burlesque, and circus acts. In 2007, The festival expanded to 3 days and broke all previous attendance records with an estimate 100,000+ fans.

===Hurricane Katrina===
In 2005, the Voodoo Music Experience was an early post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] event, billed as the "first full-scale, large entertainment event within city limits since the disastrous hurricane and subsequent flood hit the city on August 29."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1511337/10122005/nine_inch_nails.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Voodoo Music Experience Returning To New Orleans For A Day |accessdate=2008-07-13 |author=Gil Kaufman |date=2005-10-12 |work=MTV |publisher=}}</ref> At the insistence of event producer Steve Rehage, the festival was held as a free tribute concert for the first responders, military, volunteers, and returning residents six weeks after the storms. The festival took place at Riverview Park, a part of [[Audubon Park, New Orleans|Audubon Park]], and featured [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Queens of the Stone Age]], [[The Secret Machines]], [[New York Doll]] and local bands including [[Cowboy Mouth]] and [[Rebirth Brass Band]].<ref name=spera>{{cite news |first=Keith |last=Spera |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Rockin' relief; Two months ago, it appeared the Voodoo Music Experience would be another Katrina casualty. But you'd never have known it on Saturday, when the festival's trademark mix of local and national acts rocked Riverview Park |work=Times Picayune |date=2005-11-01 |ISSN=10553053  }}</ref> The festival also relocated to Memphis for the year because New Orleans was not able to support the full concert. As New Orleans recovered, Voodoo Experience returned fully to City Park in 2006 with a record-breaking attendance of over 100,000.

===2007 and 2008===
In 2007, the festival was expanded from two to three days. October 24, 2008 was the tenth event, dubbed "The Tenth Ritual."  The festival changed its name to ''Voodoo Experience'' dropping "music" from its title in 2008.

On 26 June 2008, festival organizers announced that [[Lil Wayne]], from New Orleans' [[Hollygrove, New Orleans|Hollygrove]] neighborhood, will be joining the 2008 line-up.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Lil Wayne to do the Voodoo |work=AP |publisher=Yahoo News |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2008-07-13 |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080627/ap_en_mu/people_lil_wayne}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>   On September 5, 2008 festival organizers announced [[The Mars Volta]], [[TV on the Radio]], [[Irma Thomas]], [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Ben Jelen]], [[Fishbone]] and more than 40 other performers joined the 2008 Voodoo lineup. During the second day of the festival, Lil Wayne ran over his allotted set time by over fifteen minutes and power was eventually cut from his stage. As a result, the rest of the night proceeded as planned but [[Nine Inch Nails]], the headliner for the night, was forced to cut their set slightly shorter than planned. [[N.E.R.D]] was originally slated to play on the third day of the festival but was dropped. [[Lupe Fiasco]] played his set in their place.

===2005 lineup===
Because of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the 2005 Voodoo Experience was split into two different sites (New Orleans and Memphis). The city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] was gracious enough to let Voodoo host part of the festival at its [[AutoZone Park]].  Another part of the show took place at New Orleans' Audubon Park "fly" held as a free show for the first responders, military, volunteers, and returning residents.  The show drew between 20,000-25,000&nbsp;people and featured several New Orleans musicians that had not played in the city since the storm.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001392836 |title=Voodoo Brings New Orleans Musicians Back Home |accessdate=2008-07-13 |author=Jonathan Cohen |date=2005-10-31 |work=Billboard |publisher=}}</ref>
