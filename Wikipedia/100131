'''Prince Claus of the Netherlands''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: Jhr. Claus van Amsberg; [[birth name]]: Klaus-Georg von Amsberg; 6 September 1926 &ndash; 6 October 2002) was the [[prince consort]] of the current [[Queen regnant]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Royal Monogram of Prince Claus of the Netherlands.svg|thumb|left|100px|Royal Monogram]]
Prince Claus was born '''Klaus-Georg Wilhelm Otto Friedrich Gerd von Amsberg''', on his family's estate, Haus Dötzingen, near [[Hitzacker]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. His parents were [[Claus Felix von Amsberg]] and [[Baroness Gösta von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen]]. His father, a member of the untitled [[German nobility]], operated a large farm in [[Tanganyika]] (formerly [[German East Africa]]) from 1928 until [[World War II]]. Claus and his six sisters grew up on their grandparents' manor in [[Lower Saxony]]; he also attended a boarding school in Tanganyika from 1936 to 1938.

The future prince was a member of such [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[youth organisation]]s as [[Deutsches Jungvolk]] and the [[Hitler Youth]] (membership in the latter was mandatory for all fit members of his generation) [http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/hitleryouth/hj-prelude.htm]. From 1938 until 1942, he attended the [[Baltenschule Misdroy]].

In 1944, he was conscripted into the German [[Wehrmacht]], becoming a soldier in the German [[90th Light Infantry Division (Germany)|90th Panzergrenadier Division]] in [[Italy]] in March, 1945, but taken as a [[prisoner of war]] by the [[United States|American forces]] at [[Meran]] before taking part in any fighting. After his [[repatriation]], he finished school in [[Lüneburg]] and studied [[law]] in [[Hamburg]]. He then joined the German [[diplomatic corps]] and worked in [[Santo Domingo]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. In the 1960s, he was transferred to [[Bonn]].

Claus and Beatrix met at the wedding-eve party of [[Princess Tatjana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and [[Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse]], in the summer of 1964. Sections of the Dutch population were unhappy that Beatrix's fiancé was a German, only twenty years after the end of the war, and there were protests during the wedding celebrations, most notably by the anarchist-artist group [[Provo (movement)|Provo]]. The pair nonetheless were married on 10 March 1966.

Over time, Claus became accepted by the public, so much so that during the last part of his life he was generally considered the most popular member of the Royal Family.<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/12_december/13/binnenland/maxima.xml Máxima en Claus populairste Oranje-leden]</ref>  This change in Dutch opinion was brought about by Claus's strong motivation to contribute to public causes (especially [[third-world]] development, on which he was considered an expert), his sincere modesty, his candor (within but sometimes on the edge of royal protocol), and his approachability by all levels of society.

The public also sympathised with Claus for his efforts to give meaning to his life beyond the restrictions that Dutch law imposed on the Royal Family's freedom of speech and action (lest they get involved in [[politics|political controversy]]). Many also believed that these restrictions were at least partly the cause of his severe [[depression (mood)|depression]], which lasted many years. As a result, restrictions were loosened; Claus was even appointed as senior staff member at the [[Department of Developing Aid]], albeit in an advisory role.

A fine example of his mildly rebellious attitude toward protocol was the "Declaration of the Tie".  In 1998, after presenting the annual [[Prince Claus Awards]] to three [[Africa]]n [[fashion design]]ers, Claus told "workers of all nations to unite and cast away the new [[shackle]]s they have voluntarily cast upon themselves", meaning the [[necktie]], that "snake around my neck," and encouraged the audience to "venture into open-[[collar (clothing)|collar]] [[paradise]]".  He then removed his tie and threw it on the floor.<ref>{{nl icon}} [http://nos.nl/video/47116-prins-claus-wars-van-protocol-2002.html Claus' speech in which he removes his tie, among other video fragments]</ref>

In 2001, when on Dutch television he announced the marriage of his son [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange]], and [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands|Máxima Zorreguieta]], an [[Argentina|Argentine]] woman of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Italians|Italian]] descent, Prince Claus referred to himself as more a citizen of the world than anything else.

* Klaus von Amsberg (1926–1965)
*''[[Jonkheer|Jhr.]]'' Claus van Amsberg (1965–1966); his name was changed officially after obtaining Dutch citizenship
*''[[His Royal Highness]]'' Prince Claus of the Netherlands, Jonkheer van Amsberg (1966–2002)<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/ne2/wetgeving/nederlands/besluitverleningtitelclaus.html Decree concerning the titles and names of Prince Claus after his marriage with Princess Beatrix] - Website with Legislation concerning the Royal House of the Netherlands (''[[Dutch language|Dutch]]'')</ref>

Prince Claus was appointed Honorary Fellow of The International [[Institute of Social Studies]] (ISS) in 1988. Prince Claus was held in very high esteem in the international development cooperation community, partly because of his considerable insight and understanding of the problems involved, and partly because of his exceptional gift for expressing the hopes and anxieties felt by all.
