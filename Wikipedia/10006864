*'''Keep'''. 172000 ghits for "convert or die", 215000 ghits for "forced conversion" (I'm sure the unique hit ratio is somewhat similar). The phrase also gets hits on Google Scholar, so it's a very common phrase. --- [[User:RockMFR|RockMFR]] 23:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Restore''' 

Re: Rush to delete a highly interesting phenomenon, not seeing the edited version or on the basis of blind intolerance or intolerance to critics of intolerant-jihad.

I created an entirely NEW page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Convert_or_die&oldid=114745966], which yesterday's aguments do not apply (IMHO), in deleting it so FAST... How can one see the difference?

The ones arguing for redirect or even rushing to delete... (most probably) did not see my edited vesion, which is 1) Not just an interview, 2) facts presented, 3) encylopedic terminology. 4) It is not about "race". 5) A rational person, a moderate Muslim would NOT regard exposing radicals as an "attack on all Islam".

Are the follwing sources "unreliable"? 
Or did the Guardian invented the Steve Centanni story as a "novel"? Shall I guess, the editor did not see the sources?

Sakura is a type of cherry blossom, not the other way round! Should be replaced with a short article on cherry blossom in general listing sakura as one type. [[User:MossMan|MossMan]] 14:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. There appears to be an ongoing content dispute as to whether the article should be about the concept of "cherry blossoms" or the concept of "cherry blossoms in Japan", with the article title being part of the dispute.
