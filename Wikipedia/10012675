== [[Talk:South_Tyrol#Requested_move]] ==

I have little experience in dealing with the controversial nature of a discussion [[Talk:South_Tyrol#Requested_move|such as this]], and I wondered if a more experienced hand at dealing with it could take a look.  As a summary, most users seem to agree that the name South Tyrol has got to go.  However, the conversation has dissolved into discussing and straw polling into creating up to four forks for the article.  A move is agreed, but to what name?  Miles to go.

== Spam whitelist ==

Things tend to go on the [[MediaWiki:Spam-whitelist|spam whitelist]] and get forgotten.  I started looking through it and found several sites which were not linked, some which were no longer on the blacklist anyway, some entries which simply serve to override the blacklist for entire domains (why?), some which have no place in the project anyway (e.g. ad-riddled fansites).  I have made a review page at [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist/review]] and am looking through them.  I've excluded the latest ones, which at least have comments stating why they are on the list, and added links to show "mainspace" and "all" linksearch.  I did not do this with the expectation of anyone but me reviewing it, but it is going to take a looooong time so if anyone else wants to help please do pitch in. <b>[[User Talk:JzG|Guy]]</b> <small>([[User:JzG/help|Help!]])</small> 19:29, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

::Splendid idea Guy.  I've started reviewing some of the pages.  I think a bit of context for the netfirms batch is in order... when the netfirms domain was blacklisted a while back there was consern that the many legitimate sites being referenced or linked to. Since there was a huge number of them it was decided that all the pages currently being linked to from articles on wikipedia would be "grandfathered" in. However, a careful review of those pages isn't a bad idea. Since the blacklisting/whitelisting many of those pages have gone dead or the outbound links have been replaced.
::As some have noticed Eagle and myself have worked fairly hard to catchup on the backlog on that page.  Any help in keeping an eye on the page would be appreciated. It may not be obvious at a glance, but the whitelist is an important tool in our anti-spam efforts.

== Possible serious copyright/policy violation ==

I was checking the icon [[:Image:Vista-file-manager.png]]. It's saying that the image is released under GPL, and a reference to a source at http://sa-ki.deviantart.com.
Why they have been specified as GPL here (and on countless other wiki-projects, including commons), is probably because that on http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=28352 it's specified as GPL. 

The problem arise when looking on the authors own page about these icons  http://www.iconsdesigns.com/?page_id=44. There it's a notice saying:
{{"|These free icons are provided to be used as a replacement icon theme for your operating system only. You can also use them on your open source projects. For non open source projects such as commercial ones, products website, personal website, blog, commercial or personal applications, documentation, etc. asking a permission to use them is mandatory and you will have to give credit for them. Thank you!}}

If this hold, then the icons is not compatible with the rules for images used on the projects. <sub>→[[User:AzaToth|<span style="color:#773">Aza</span>]][[User_talk:AzaToth|<span style="color:#359">Toth</span>]]</sub> 02:46, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

:I'm no law-talking person. However, the user uploaded the icon set under the GPL, and the package itself contains a copy of the license, even if he states in another location and seemingly at a later time that it is under a more restrictive license.

== [[brian d foy]] rename ==

I saw [[brian d foy]] (previously at [[Brian D. Foy]]) at [[WP:RM]], and after reading [[Talk:Brian_d_foy#Requested_move_2|the discussion]], concluded that the consensus was to move the article. There was the issue that a lot of the support arguments were made by anonymous users and uses with very few edits, but I was sure to take that into account. Now, [[User:Chriscf]] has come to me saying that my conclusion that there was consensus is incorrect: [[User talk:Enochlau#brian_d_foy]]. I've discussed it a little with him, and I still think that there was consensus, and I respect his disagreement with my decision - but I would like some more feedback. Without commenting on whether the article should be at one title or another, I was wondering if other administrators could comment on whether they think there is consensus to move, or whether it should be "no consensus" or even consensus to keep at the old name. [[User:Enochlau|enochlau]] ([[User talk:Enochlau|talk]]) 02:30, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:I'm going to chip in here, so as not to feel like I'm pressuring Enochlau on their talk page.  To cut a long story short, this is my perspective on it:
:*[[WP:MOS#Identity]] refers to words people use to describe themselves, and the only thing you could derive from it about name is that if someone has a professional alias and prefers to be so referred, we use that (e.g. use of "[[Elton John]]" vs "Reg Dwight" - in this case, we include the meaningless "D", as we have for [[Richard E Grant]]).
:*Mention of [[WP:NCON]] is a red herring since semantically the two forms are identical - it is only the rendering in capitals or lower-case that was contested at the move.
:*The examples that were provided were themselves anomalous (one was even [[fIREHOSE|incorrect]]), and were cited by supporters of the move as "precedent" - the exception was put forward as being the rule.
:*With all things considered, the only arguments left were "Support, brian prefers it that way" vs. "Oppose, per the rules of English".  
:*As far as I am aware, judging the consensus position on Wikipedia involves weighing up the ''arguments'', not the ''numbers'' (such that 200 turkeys cannot block one person's proposal in favour of Christmas).
:This just about sums it up.  I'm also somewhat confused, since I also don't know where we go when a [[WP:RM]] comes out clearly wrong.

::The most relevant guideline is [[WP:NCP]], not the MoS.  You can boil our naming conventions down to "the most common name of a person or thing that does not conflict with the names of other people or things" (I'm quoting that directly).  While not specifically addressing pen names that contravene grammar, it does specify that pen names should be used rather than legal names if that is what the person is better known as, which I think is the case here.  At any rate, enochlau asked us to chime in on whether he/she read the consensus correctly, and I believe that it was.  With all due respect Chris, the arguments in favor were not invalid, as it appears you believe (?) — in fact, most were directly in line with the naming conventions.

== Legal Concerns ==

In the Vintage Nude Photographs section on wikicommons http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Vintage_nude_photographs I am concerned about several photos that I believe consitute Child Pornography. I believe that these photos should be removed to avoid potential legal trouble for wikipedia. -[[User:Vcelloho|Vcelloho]] 02:06, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
:Though I am no legal expert, I believe that child pornography is defined  in American law as visual depictions of minors in explicit sexual acts (or similar wording). These do not resemble overt sexual depictions, and hence are not legally defined as child porn. I am in no way defending or lawyering on child porn, however. —<sup>[[User talk:Physicq210|<font color="000000">210</font>]]</sup>'''[[User:Physicq210|<font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font>]]''' (''[[Special:Contributions/Physicq210|<font color="#0000C0">c</font>]]'') 02:35, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
::Acording to United States vs. Dost the six qualifiers are.
# whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child's genital, pubic or anal areas
# whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity
# whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child
# whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude
# whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity
# whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.
I believe that qualifiers 1,2,3,4,in my opinion 5, and in my opinion 6. 
Due to this I belive that It constitues child pornography. I am meerly concerned about a potential legal issue that could be caused by three of the photos. -[[User:Vcelloho|Vcelloho]] 02:40, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Per UBeR above, "I believe we are drifting further and further off the issue at hand," let's get back to actual thougths. I really appreciate the citation from ''United States vs. Dost''. Unfortunately, criteria #2, #3, #5 and #6 are rather subjective. Arguably the visual depiction ''is'' sexually suggestive, but arguably it is not. Opinions can be tossed back and forth, but how is this defined objectively? Criterion #3 is a bit less subjective; personally, I feel that the children, who seem to be standing in somewhat natural poses, are not necessarily in unnatural poses. I consider criterion #5 kind of as a double standard: the children do seem coy, but not willing to or leading up to engagement in sexual activity. Criterion #6 is also subjective: I personally did not feel a sexual response to the images, but I can see that someone -- for whatever reason, or maybe simply not because of any particular reason -- could feel a sexual response. In general, I think that because these images are important artistically and historically, the Wikimedia Foundation or the uploaders of the photographs should not worry about pending litigation. Arguably the images are child pornography, but arguably they are not. It is inappropriate to enforce one's values on others -- and, as is apparent, some people consider these images pornographic and others do not -- and since these are not as blatant as children engaged in sexual activity, I consider it appropriate not to delete them.

== If this a personal attack ==

I would like everyone to consider this. I have a content dispute over Politkovskaya article with user Biophys. I have inserted criticism of Politkovskaya which was constantly deleted by Biophys who claims that it violates BLP policies, although the source is respectable Russian newspaper published in English - [[Moscow News]]. Afterwards, article was rightly protected by Alex Bakharev who wrote that we should reach consensus. 

Then, here http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Biophys&oldid=114456838#Other_important_edits, Biophys wrote that Politkovskaya article "(***) Articles currently vandalized by a wikistalker. Please help!". 

Moreover, Biophys has a long history of bad relations with me. His friend Colchicum filed the RfC on me here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Vlad_fedorov, but it failed, since their third collegue had withdrawn his signature, after administrators wrote comments not supporting their allegations. 

Could anyone stop this witchhunt waged by Biophys? When I add something to the article he deletes it and writes it violates BLP policy, or writes it is unreliable source. It's really stupid, my sources are awlays wrong and unreliable, according to Biophys.

:What on earth is your purpose in posting that here? It appears to be someone putting together an Rfc in their namespace, a very good idea, as one can organize, edit, and consider whether or not to proceed while doing so. In many cases editors decide not to file and simply blank or delete these "draft" Rfc's. As it is not yours, you cannot be asking for assistance in how to write an Rfc.

== [[User:Magonaritus|Magonaritus]] and sockpuppetry ==

The person who registered the {{User|Magonaritus}} account has been causing disruptions, on and off, at [[Upper Canada College]] and the relevant [[Talk:Upper Canada College|talk page]] for over a year. He/she has used a series of both IP and registered sockpuppets to influence the outcome of discussions on article content and format at talk, generally in an abrasive, uncooperative manner; all-together violating [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:NOR]], [[WP:AGF]], [[WP:CIV]], [[WP:NPA]], [[WP:NLT]], [[WP:NOT#SOAP]], [[WP:VAND]], [[WP:POINT]], and, of course, [[WP:SOCK]], leading to edit wars and the page being locked. Evidence strongly points to sockpuppetry; such evidence and connections have been outlined [[User:G2bambino/temp|here]]. A [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Magonaritus|request for checkuser]] was already deemed unnecessary.

== More Mike Church ==

(originally posted at [[WP:AN/I]], but this seems to be the more appropriate place, as it isn't an isolated incident)

{{vandal|Mike Church}} is more than one admin can handle, but apparently I'm the only one still doing anything about his vandalism after two years. I'd like to get others to be able to identify him so they can revert and block his sockpuppets.

Mike has never forgiven Wikipedia for not letting him self-promote [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Ambition (cards)|his card game]], and for years he's been engaging in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mike_Church&diff=prev&oldid=43860974 admitted sneaky vandalism], which got him indefinitely blocked.

He has since created [[:Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Mike Church|approximately a gazillion sockpuppets]]. A very old list of sockpuppets is at [[User:Jerzy/Church & Supporters or Socks]], and watching that page (which Mike occasionally tries to blank or modify) is a way of identifying some of his new sockpuppets.

Three of his recent sockpuppets are named [[User:PWnsivander the Great]], [[User:Rspeer drinks the haterade]], and [[User:Rv this and get DOSpwn3d]]. The "DOSpwn" part presumably means he's about to increase his rate of vandalism.

Some patterns of editing that point to Mike Church:
* Use of the word "pwn", especially when stating that admins have been "pwn3d"
* Spreading memes from the [[AutoAdmit]] board, particularly about "prestige"
* Altering information about himself in Wikipedia space to try to confuse the issues (he'll probably alter this entry, so watch the history)
* Altering articles such as [[Prestige (sociology)]] and [[Careerism]] to reflect his unique worldview
* Bringing WP disputes off of Wikipedia, such as when he created the entry [[wikt:loser-fucker]] containing names of users who reverted him
* Self-promotion of his own ideas; once these focused on his card game "Ambition", but he's given up on that. Another example would be adding [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gin_rummy&diff=18081443&oldid=15949263 his own scoring system] to the [[Gin rummy]] article.

If you watch some of these pages I've linked, or presumably even the edit history of this exact section, you'll be able to find more sockpuppets. I appreciate any help.

As you probably know, the [[Wikipedia:Community noticeboard]] is a reasonably new noticeboard. Its purpose is somewhat unclear; it would seem that most topics there would belong just as easily on the village pump, or the admin board. Several people have pointed this out on the talk page, and suggested it be shut down. Now obviously we need noticeboards with a variety of functions, but it seems to me we should have a good discussion about which boards those should be, before we get a bunch of redundant boards. Having a lot of unclear-purpose boards encourage misposts, crossposts, and divergent discussion, and confuse people and force people to needlessly look in multiple places.

In <s>a fit of insanity</s> an attempt to get people to talk, I've posted a 'temporarily suspended' notice on the board, and protected it because I thought someone would blindly that <small>(indeed, someone did while I was typing the protection summary)</small>. Please let us discuss to create a useful set of noticeboards, for clarity's sake.

* This really is bloody silly.

The board recently went up on [[WP:MFD]] and the result was ''early and speedy keep'' plus an apology from the nominator.  Unilateral suspension and protection are way out of line, and under these circumstances the action is unseemly.

I also think we are very close to a consensus on what that purpose is, and I think there is some merit to reviewing again in a month to see if the scope is creeping or if the thing is still working.  There's nothing wrong with having a debate about these things.  I think Radiant! was a bit precipitate, but not evil, he has spent a lot of time lately working on cutting back instruction creep, which is a good thing.

== ongoing edit war over inclusion of a category ==

I'm not sure where to post this. For the past two weeks (since [[February 28]] as far as I can tell) an edit war over the [[:Category:Anti-Islam sentiment]] has been ongoing on the [[Vlaams Belang]] article. The first few edits declared inclusion of that category was biased (category was nominated for deletion till today, no consensus either way was found) respectively not biased. But now for several days it's simply a game of reversions. No one has yet broken the triple revert rule but the continual reverting seems disruptive. It might even involve other problems (stalking and sock puppetry). I have so far not been involved, just watching from the sidelines (except for placing a vote against deletion in the category vote). yesterday I decided to ask on the [[Talk:Vlaams Belang]] page that the waring parties try and explain why the category would be biased, or why it would not be biased in this particular case. But the article has been reverted six times since then. I have not tried to contact editors as I'd prefer not to get too involved in this issue (I won't claim to be neutral, but I don't feel strongly enough about this particular issue to wish to be drawn into that fight). At this point I don't see what else I could do and hope that maybe an administrator's intervention, or just any editor with more experience could improve matters. As a last resort the page could be fully protected (one of the edit waring parties is an annon, but semi protection would seem like taking sides in this issue) for a time to see whether the issue can be debated on the talk page.--[[User:Caranorn|Caranorn]] 15:40, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<rant>When this board first opened I started threads both here and at [[WP:AN]] requesting discussion and improvement for the header.  Nobody paid attention.  Finally I dug in and did something myself.  It wasn't perfect, but frankly the way this whole situation has been unfolding has me quite disappointed because those threads I started got ignored, then people tried rash and unilateral action ''because'' the community hadn't addressed those issues in an appropriate manner.

There's a similar ''propose discussion...ignore...fester...'' dynamic happening again at this board, at [[WP:RFAR]], and [[Wikipedia talk:Banning policy]]: developing precedents and needed refinements aren't getting discussed and written into [[WP:BAN]] and [[WP:DE]] the way they ought to be.  [[WP:RFAR#Arthur_Ellis|Two]] [[WP:RFAR#Request_to_review_indefinite_block_of_User:BabyDweezil|proproposed]] cases now before ArbCom seek to appeal their community bans in part because the community banned editors were already indef blocked when the community ban discussion opened and weren't notified while the relevant ban discussion was ongoing.  Hence, they were effectively denied the means of defense.  Yet the [[WP:BAN#Community_ban|current policy language]] actually instructs sysops to ban first and ask questions later.  We ought to address these matters on the community level because one of those requests for arbitration is on the verge of acceptance and if the community abandons its collective obligation to discuss and refine procedures in a timely and appropriate manner the Committee might make those decisions for us.  Yet no one has made a topical response to my [[Wikipedia_talk:Banning_policy#Community_banning|two]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Community_noticeboard&diff=113833592&oldid=113709840 threads] on the subject - and the thread I initiated to this noticeboard got deleted without making it into the archives.  Neither the policy nor the guideline has been updated to reflect [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_arbitration&diff=111645175&oldid=111643011 this important precedent] that establishes the community's right to topic ban or to reflect other valid concerns are showing up at ArbCom's doorstep.  Community banning was meant to lighten their workload, not add to it.

If it seems like I'm getting testy about this, I am.  I've been thinking far enough ahead to ask the arbitration clerks to [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration#Archiving_of_community_ban-related_requests|archive]] rejected community ban discussions, and doing more than my share to initiate discussion in a timely manner, yet it's my userpage that gets [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Durova&diff=114390629&oldid=102108148 vandalized] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Durova&diff=114391473&oldid=114391123 repeatedly] because a disgruntled editor chooses [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&diff=prev&oldid=114390365 target me] after the community sticks its head in the sand while I do my best to [[WP:RFAR#Statement_by_Durova_2|raise these issues]].  At this point I'm tempted per [[WP:BOLD]] to update the policy myself.  I can reasonably argue that discussion has been open long enough and no one has disagreed.  Yet instead of topical discussion the knee jerk action - in the embarrassing [[WP:PAIN]] and [[WP:RFI]] tradition - is ''blame the noticeboard.''  This is not the way to handle things.</rant> <font face="Verdana">[[User:Durova|<span style="color:#009">Durova</span>]]</font><sup>''[[User talk:Durova|Charge!]]''</sup> 20:58, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

== {{user|Wikiwatch}} ==

Hey, I'm a bit worried about this user. A quick perusal of their contributions shows that all edits have been done concerning things with the [[New York Times]]; what's more, they all seem to be trying to put the Times in a better light. I'm quite worried this is a roll account. I would say more, but I really gtg. Someone ''please'' look into this. I know we've had some major bruhahas in the past over roll accounts, and this one reeks pretty badly, especially given the username seems to say as much - unfortunately, it is a registered user, so we can't see via the IP if it's a roll account or not. This is particularly harmful becuase the user has frequently changed the [[New York Times]] article to take out any suggestions that something might be wrong (e.g., frequent removal of liberal bias comments and a move of the [[Jason Blair]] scandal from modern to historical scandals).

== Reverting removal of vandalism warnings by the vandal -- is it vandalism? ==

Several users are arguing about this issue. My opinion is that if a vandal removes warning from his page, then he is interfering with the process of keeping track of his vandalism so that appropriate warnings or blocks can be made. Thus his removal is vandalism; and we should revert it and give him another warning. {{user|MrDarcy}} (who is apparently an administrator), claims that such reversion and additional warning would itself be vandalism by the "enforcer". And he is threatening to give warnings and blocks to those who do that. What is the policy on this matter? Thanks for your help. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] 07:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

:Up until recently there were specific warning templates advising vandals that removing legitimate warning templates was also vandalism.  I agree that it is necessary for legitimate warnings to stay on vandals' pages, so others on vandal patrol can see the prior offenses without having to dig through the history.  It is almost always the worst vandals who promptly remove the warnings, often doubling the workload for those of us trying to stop them. <font face="Georgia">[[User:Kathryn NicDhàna|<span style="color:navy"> ~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span>]] [[User_talk:Kathryn NicDhàna|♫]]<font color="navy">♦</font>[[Special:Contributions/Kathryn_NicDhàna|♫]]</font> 07:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

::Those templates were intentionally deleted because many people agree with MrDarcy (though perhaps with weaker language) that reverting vandalism warnings is generally inappropriate.  While I understand your concern about tracking the worst vandals, allowing such reversions also encourages harassment of generally good users that simply make mistakes.  The amount of problems they were creating was disproportionate to the amount of good a little extra tracking was doing since any admin worth his title ought to already be reviewing histories.

:::The discussion [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Removing_warnings_poll here] seems to me to show strong consensus that valid warnings need to stay on a vandal's page, and that removing them is wrong. <font face="Georgia">[[User:Kathryn NicDhàna|<span style="color:navy"> ~ Kathryn NicDhàna</span>]] [[User_talk:Kathryn NicDhàna|♫]]<font color="navy">♦</font>[[Special:Contributions/Kathryn_NicDhàna|♫]]</font> 07:59, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Mine is far more recent.  That poll (which I helped create) does not reflect current policy.  As [[WP:VAND]], "removing warnings from one's own talk page is often frowned upon" replaced the statements that removing warnings was vandalism.  While removing warnings might be a cause for further dispute resolution, it is not presently considered a form of vandalism and should not be indiscriminately reverted.  [[User:Dragons flight|Dragons flight]] 08:05, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

It's so easy to solve, just make sure your edit summary reflects the fact you gave them a warning. Then it will not matter if they remove it and the next person will just need to look at the history page and not go though several revisions. [[Wikipedia:Use common sense]] applies.

:Just chiming in as another admin '''strongly''' against edit-warring in an attempt to force the talk page display of material a user does not want. Talk pages exist to facilitate >communication< with the user. Not to serve as a perpetual 'wall of shame' for every condemnation that any random user chooses to place there. If you want to review past problems check the page history and/or the block log... that is ''their'' purpose, not the talk page's. --[[User talk:CBDunkerson|CBD]] 12:04, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with CBD, and would just like to point out that if vandalism comes from an IP, that IP could be used the next day by a completely different person who is adding useful content. If it comes from a registered user, I imagine that in most cases, the account should be blocked indefinitely. I'm basing that on my feeling that there would be ''very'' few registered users who add the word "poop" to the article about George W. Bush today and add useful content to the article on contact lenses tomorrow. But surely a user should not be forced to display warnings that annoy or embarrass him. If that were the case, we'd need to change the titles from "user warnings" to "user black marks". When I send a warning, I'm careful to put something like "uw-vandalism2" in the edit summary, so that an admin can look briefly at the history, without checking the diffs, and see that someone has been warned. I'd hope, in any case, that an admin would check for vandalism carried out by the vandal before blocking, rather than warnings issued to the vandal, as I'm sure there are some who might misuse the warning templates if they disagree with an edit or want to harass someone. Just my two cents. [[User:ElinorD|ElinorD]] [[User talk:ElinorD|(talk)]] 12:26, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

:: Remember the point in the warnings is to get them to stop vandalising, if they just blank the warning and do nothing then it worked. If they continue just add the next warning if appropriate, most who are intent on vandalising will just continue and It'll get to a blockable level reasonably quickly. If it comes to an AIV report you can note that warnings were removed. The other side to consider is that of attention seeking, some of those involved in this are incapable of gaining attention for positive contributions and would rather gain attention from the negative, edit warring over warnings is just feeding that attention seeking. If they are replacing the warning with taunts, abuse etc. then keep cool and if need be ask for an admin to see about protecting the page/blocking. --[[User_talk:Pgk|pgk]] 12:44, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

I think there is definitely some gray area here.  Maybe there should be some sort of time period that warnings are expected to remain.  If an editor is removing current (24 hours for logged in users, less for IPs) warnings and continuing the actions that led to the warning in the first place, I would consider the removal as an additional act of vandalism. /shrug. --[[User:Onorem|Onorem]] 12:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

:If they remove the template, then they have clearly seen it.  The purpose of these templates is not to blackmark users, it is to ask (then urge, then tell, then warn) users not to vandalise (be incivil, edit war, etc).  If they have seen the message, then the purpose of the template has been achieved.  Reapplying such templates if the user has removed them is edit warring; it should not be done.

::No. I can revert a page without viewing the content. If someone has been doing something or engaging in inappropriate behaviour and sees my name as having just edited his talk page, he can easily revert it without actually reading what I wrote.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 19:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
Perhaps the discussion could be narrowed to focus strictly on anonymous IP users as a starting point.  The majority of vandalism comes from anonymous users.  Since anonymous users do not generally have the same rights as account holders[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales/Archive_11#Repeated_Administrator_abuses] and user talk pages are a community asset, not personal, it's reasonable that a pattern of vandalism should be required to stand on the talk page for a period of time.  The removal of vandalism warnings slows down the enforcement process.  I don't look at page history or edit summaries when placing vandalism warnings.  It is a waste of time - and often time is valuable when trying to stop a rampant vandal (at least when you have to get the warnings documented before you can report to [[WP:AIV]]).  What about those vandal patrollers who are using tools like VandalProof?  They are likely to put a test1 on someone who has been blocked 3 times in the last month just because of a blanked page.  If the user can be penalized for blanking the page, it will either act as a deterrent or demonstrate malice on the part of the user.  -- <font color="#000080">Mufka</font> [[User:Mufka|<sup>(user)</sup>]] [[User talk:Mufka|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mufka|<sup>(contribs)]]</sup> 17:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

:No idea how VP works, but honestly, if the page has been blanked it's fairly obvious that one has to check the history to look for previous warnings. -- [[User:Consumed Crustacean|Consumed Crustacean]] <small>([[User talk:Consumed Crustacean|talk]])</small> 17:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

: It's not about penalizing people, it's about preventing disruption, starting wars over user talk content is in itself disruptive. When dealing with a vandal you should always be checking their recent contributions anyway to revert any as yet undetected vandalism, this will tell you if they've blanked their page and if they have indeed been up to any other misdeeds recently. --[[User_talk:Pgk|pgk]] 18:51, 7 March 2007 (UTC)
::Its also about civility.  And while on a low-traffic talk page of an IP its easy to check for previous warnings, on a busy talk page of a long-time user (yes they can still make mistakes), it can be near impossible to dig through and find those. Warnings are no different than any other kind of talk. We consider it a civility issue if someone is constantly blanking talk on his talk page without responding to it. So why should valid warnings be any different? They're still communication. There is no reason valid warnings on a talk page should be treated differently than valid communication and they can both be archived as appropriate.  We've established that users don't own their talk page, even though they're given some latitude with it, its a place where a record of communication with other users is kept.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 19:17, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

:::If one has to scan the history of a page to find warnings (and talk pages can often have lengthy histories), figuring out who to block becomes a real chore. If the warnings are left on the talk page, it becomes much easier to find out what level the vandal is at, in turn making it easier to escalate the template level when appropriate. Users don't own their talk pages, and vandals, in my opinion, should have more restrictions because of their proven malicious intents (at least persistent vandals should). If a warning is unwarranted, because the user did not perform the edit in question (the warner made a mistake), they are welcome to remove it themselves, but some users (IPs and registered users) have simply blanked their talk pages, regardless of whether or not the warnings previously displayed had been valid or read. As far as I'm concerned, archiving to a page linked from the main page is OK; blanking/deletion is not OK. — [[User:Voyagerfan5761|Tuvok]][<sup>[[User talk:Voyagerfan5761|T]][[Special:Emailuser/Voyagerfan5761|@]][[User talk:Voyagerfan5761|lk]]</sup>/<sub>[[Wikipedia:Editor review/Voyagerfan5761|Improve me]]</sub>] 22:42, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

::::It would also become an issue if, for instance, a long-time user had an issue with a certain subject which he only edited occasionally.  If there were warnings in relation to it, and that person consistently blanked them, any future people leaving notices in regards to some inappropriate behaviour in regards to a certain subject might never be able to notice the pattern and realize it probably needed addressed more than a simple warning.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 00:34, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
::: Two additional comments on this;  If a user does not have an account and is therefore showing up as an anonymous IP, it should just go with the territory that the user might have vandalism warnings sitting on the talk page from a previous user.  The user doesn't own the talk page.  We could just have a template that explains the situation very politely to the next user of the ip.  On that same idea, the majority of anon ip's don't change from day to day or even month to month. It is reasonable that a user who is vandalizing on that ip will be back on the same ip to do it again (if they do it again).  The second, and perhaps more important, is that I don't want to see vandal patrollers getting scolded by an admin who believes that blanking the talk page is not a bad thing.  It makes us all look stupid if we can't agree on what the policy is and how it can be enforced.  -- <font color="#000080">Mufka</font> [[User:Mufka|<sup>(user)</sup>]] [[User talk:Mufka|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] [[Special:Contributions/Mufka|<sup>(contribs)]]</sup> 03:04, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

::::A template would be good. I think several exist, it would be a matter of ensuring that they get on all IP talk pages. I still can't find a "good" reason for blanking warnings when other communication is allowed to stay unless its an attempt to hide it. Thats assuming bad faith, but honestly I just cannot think of a good faith reason to blank valid warnings unless you're consistently blanking your entire talk page (which you shouldn't really be doing anyway).--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 22:42, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

::: If this is an established editor with that much throughput on their talk page that a brief viewing of the page history won't make the issue obvious, I'd say that's all the more reason to not worry about them keeping warnings visible if they don't want them. We should be looking to the bigger picture in such cases not merely counting warnings. The warning templates aren't something to bash people with, if the issue has been resolved and moved on from (i.e. they've read it and "conformed") then we don't need chanting of "unclean". --[[User_talk:Pgk|pgk]] 22:51, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Actually it is. Because its much easier for an established editor to cover up an issue that way. If someone doesn't seen any obvious warnings to this person they might just leave another civil1, and move on and think nothing of it. What they don't notice on this editors busy talk page is maybe he's had a half dozen of those over the last year, but its never involved the same editors, so no one picks up on it. That would be an indication that perhaps it should be taken to another level for input and possible handling of the situation. As I pointed out, there is no good reason to remove warnings if they were valid. Absolutely 100% none. And "feeling like it" isn't a good reason. If I ask you a question and you blank it, its considered uncivil. It should be no different with warnings. Its just communication. There is no reason it can't be archived in 7 days along with everything else, or whatever the regular archiving period is on that particular users talk page.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 03:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
::::: Well that fails [[WP:AGF]], assuming it is done for "an established editor to cover an issue", doesn't cut it. Regardless of if you see it as uncivil is irrelevant, yes we want people to be civil, do we block people for being mildly uncivil, no. Which is more disruptive removing some warnings they've read and understood or Assumptions of bad faith concerning that warning and edit warring over the removal. --[[User_talk:Pgk|pgk]] 07:29, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::We don't blindly assume good faith. And if you can't provide a "good" reason for the removal of the warnings before normal archiving, I'm not violating that. If a single good scenario can't be provided for their removal, yet bad scenarios can easily be though of, AGF doesn't apply. There also wouldn't be any edit warning if we established a policy on their removal. Hence why this discussion is here. We don't block people for being mildly uncivil no. But if someone is consistently uncivil in all dealings he has with a particular subject (Lets say historical figures from a certain state, it doesn't really matter what) If a keen eyed editor notices this while leaving the individual a warning, he may try and intervene and recommend that the editor not edit those kinds of articles or if the editor ignores that and continues to be uncivil in regards to those articles, it may go to a point where the editor is officially banned from editing those kinds of articles. There are also other kinds of sneaky vandalism that long time editors could get away with by being allowed to bury warnings. There is also no assumption of bad faith in my saying that they shouldn't be allowed to wipe the warning right away. I'm simply saying that it is communication and it shouldn't be treated any differently.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 17:01, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::: Yes we do blindly assume good faith, when we have some evidence of bad faith in an action then that assumption evaporates. If someone removes a warning and doesn't continue the behaviour they were warned about that is not evidence of bad faith in removal of the warning. --[[User_talk:Pgk|pgk]] 18:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::::: So you're saying if I leave a NPA warning on someone's talk page, they blank and then repeat the behaviour, it is evidence and obviously the blanking of the warning is in bad faith? At that point then, since obviously the person was acting in bad faith by blanking the warning, that warning, and probably all others can be restored? What about future blankings? If those warnings were restored, and they're immediately blanked again, do we restore them since the user has demonstrated they're willing to ignore warnings? Are you willing to keep the tally sheet on which user is allowed to blank warnings because they haven't messed up again? Quite a tangled web. Its much easier to simply say that warnings are the same as any other communication and should be treated as such.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 20:39, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
::::::::: I'm not saying you should restore warnings under any circumstances. I'm saying assuming that just removing of a warning is indicative of some "bad intent" goes against [[WP:AGF]], if someone does remove a warning and then continues it seems go evidence of disruptive behaviour. Post a further warning for the fresh behaviour, if the disruption continues that's when we block. i.e. If I post a test2 template (or uw- whatever) on someones talk page and they remove it, and repeat the same action then any assumption that their original edit may have been a genuine mistake/test has gone out the window they certainly read the warning, there is no doubt they intend to be disruptive. "Its much easier to simply say that warnings are the same as any other communication and should be treated as such" - yep and I'm free to remove any other message I see fit from my talk page, as is any other editor, it's not vandalism, it's not something to edit war over. --[[User_talk:Pgk|pgk]] 20:49, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::::::Thats not the impression I've gotten from people. A talk page is a record of communication and you don't own your talk page. You're given some latitude with it, but in the end you don't own it. I've seen it mentioned more than once that removing messages on your talk page without responding can be seen as uncivil, and that your talk page should be archived in a useful manner (if blanked, diffs to various versions should be included) or via something like werdnabot. Editing others comments is frowned upon, regardless of the place (unless its formatting the position of the message), and blanking someone's comment, whether its a comment or a warning, would fall under that too. So while it may be your talk page, and I should assume good faith in your wanting to blank the warning right away, you should realize you don't own your talk page, and you shouldn't edit my comments. This isn't a one way street. And in the absence of any good reason for removing warnings right away, I don't see any kind of reason this should lean so heavily towards that side. The middle ground would be to allow an individual to blank warnings until they show bad faith, but I think I just covered what a gong show that would be. You assume that this would be something that would be edit warred over, but an official policy should hopefully nip a lot of that in the bud. As someone pointed out before the only policy was kind of vague.--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 21:06, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

Make a report to AIV, an administrator can restore them, provide a final warning (because honestly if this takes more than 2 warnings to get across, there is a malfunction in the junction) and then lock the talk page. This makes sure all talk is readily available. The warnings should provide links on how to archive a talk page and links to say the village pump if the individual feels a warning is unfair, or they need help understanding it.

I see that your proposal is specifically for IP addresses, but lots of others have said this should apply to registered talk pages as well.  Here's the problem: Say I'm having a dispute with User X.  I am being civil and refraining from personal attacks.  User X leaves an npa-2 warning on my talk page, even though it is entirely unfounded.  Is removing it vandalism?  If yes, can others remove it?  If so, will we need to set up a noticeboard for requests for independent editors to investigate whether the warning was warranted and if not, to remove it?  Obviously this would be a bigger problem with registered user talk pages, but we also have some VERY good IP editors (one in particular, of course, comes to mind).  Would this policy apply to him?  Why or why not?
It's really not that difficult to check the history page, especially if something about the user seems fishy to you.  If they are vandalizing and they blank their talk page, block 'em.  That's completely in line with present policy, in which blanking warnings can only be considered disruption in the presence of other disruption (such as vandalism).

:If a warning message is placed on a users talk page and its completely unfounded then it can be removed. Removing it wouldn't be vandalism. The burden of proof would be on the individual who placed the warning to provide diffs where they felt the behaviour occurred. If they can't, the warning can be removed. If its patently false, i.e. a copyvio template left about the George bush article and you've never edited that article. Remove it, and indicate that in your edit summary.

:::Right, there isn't going to be a change in policy because the alternative is the massive [[m:Instruction creep|instruction creep]] that Crossmr mentions: if someone on vandal patrol posts a warning, he/she needs to monitor the page because if the user removes the warning as unfounded, the vandal patroller has to go back and provide diffs, right?

If someone erases a warning on their talk page, then before you accuse them of vandalizing Wikipedia  you have a responsibility to make sure that the person erased the warning in bad faith. You'd have to double-check their contributions to see whether the warning they erased is valid or not. This easily eats up more time than we save by trying to discourage people from erasing messages. It does happen that people - often new users - are warned inappropriately and then erase the warning. I came across a case recently in which an article was vandalized, someone fixed most of the vandalism, and the vandalism-fixer got blamed for the original vandalism. The person rightly blanked the nonsensical nonsensical warning from his/her talk page, and got for that another vandalism warning. If we are going to warn people who erase warnings, the least we can do is say so politely and not use the word "vandalism." [[User:Clayoquot|Kla'quot]] 05:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

The idea behind this straw poll is that perhaps we have had enough of idea gathering and now it is time to specify the ideas in a yes/no form so a straw poll can tell us where we stand. Perhaps there will be a concensus on some of the proposals. Once the field is narrowed down we can discuss the detals. A week should be long for this straw poll so people can ask and answer questions about each proposal and everyone who wants to can have an informed !vote. The poll's instructions are to vote yes to any or all that seem similar to what is needed; and no to any or all that that are fundamentally unsound. We are weeding out stuff more than selecting a winner. Identify specific details you like or don't like if you wish. Feel free to change or add a comment to your vote at any time.

== Covert edit war in progress ==

There is currently an edit war in progress on [[Rudolf Höß]], where a user called [[User:Trueblood]] is blanking and re-blanking material about Hoess's dates of rank in the SS and his Nazi awards.  Trueblood has been approached about this blanking by at least three people, and has indicated strong anti-nazi feelings with hints that he simply feels that an article about a Nazi should not be so detailed.  He spreads these blankings out over several days, trying to hide them and making them appear as "cleaning up" the article of "shortening material" when it is in fact just blatant blanking.  He also sometimes pretends to compromise, but in the end just keeps reblanking the same material over and over again.  I teach history and think this mateiral absolutely should be in the article.  It is well referenced and informative.  Someone with anti-nazi feelings should not simply keep reblanking it because they don't like it being in there.  As this has been going on for at least a month, and as Trueblood has ignored requests both on the article talk-page and his own talk-page to stop this, I'm asking for admin assistance. -[[User:195.229.236.214|195.229.236.214]] 11:43, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

I was checking the icon [[:Image:Vista-file-manager.png]]. It's saying that the image is released under GPL, and a reference to a source at http://sa-ki.deviantart.com.
Why they have been specified as GPL here (and on countless other wiki-projects, including commons), is probably because that on http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=28352 it's specified as GPL. 

The problem arise when looking on the authors own page about these icons  http://www.iconsdesigns.com/?page_id=44. There it's a notice saying:
{{"|These free icons are provided to be used as a replacement icon theme for your operating system only. You can also use them on your open source projects.

:There are two counter issues: (1) You can release works under multiple licenses, which may be incompatible with each other; in that case a recipient may use whichever licenses they received.  In case of copyleft licenses like the GPL, if the images are released under GPL and some other license, then anyone can use them under GPL if they choose.  (2) It's not 100% clear in case law, but in general you can't "rescind" something you previously properly released under GPL, though what typically happens when a software author wants to use a more restrictive license is they release newer versions under a different license.  Here there's no reason to believe that the author has wanted to rescind the GPL anyway, only that he has released it under a vague non-commercial/by-permission-only license in addition to GPL. Conclusion: We're fine, you can use new icons if you want (e.g. since SVG is preferred to non-SVG), but there's no pressing need to delete the old ones. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—[[User:Quarl|Quarl]] <sup>([[User Talk:Quarl|talk]])</sup> <small>2007-03-14 10:08Z</small></i></span>
== [[WP:AMA]] ==

How can we fix the AMA?  It's a noble and probably necessary idea: users who are banned or blocked or just don't get it need people who can hold their hand and help them through the processes of dispute resolution and mediation.  Yup.  What they don't need is someone who mistakes their role for that of a legal advocate.  I have to say that my view of AMA is strongly coloured by the fact that [[user:CyclePat]] is an Advocate.  Pat is a lovely guy, passionate about what he does, but has a positive gift for escalating disputes and rubbing people up the wrong way.  There are many great uses of Pat's talents but this is not one of them.  Other advocates are similarly problematic: I have seen one take a case and do nothing, leaving it there as a cesspit of argument for months, for example.

Likewise, people expect that advocates can help them to win disputes by stepping in and making a decision, which is absolute crap (of course). The best way to resolve this would be to rename the group, look through and check the members list (or abolish it), remove much of the bureaucracy (meetings every month..) and make sure that users requesting the services of the AMA know what they can reasonably get. Personally (as an AMA deputy co-ordinator), I feel that Arbitration advocacy will never work, given the bad reputation the AMA already has, and the fact that an advocate will rarely be able to give more insight into a dispute than a clued up disputant. The job of the AMA should not be to actively fight cases - it should be to clue up these (frequently) new users on the ins and outs of policy. <strong>[[User:Martinp23|Mart]]<font color="red">[[User_talk:Martinp23|inp23]]</font></strong> 18:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

== User warning templates strawpoll ==

Most of you are aware of the work that was done over the previous 6 months by the user warnings project [[WP:UW]] and then when handed over [[WP:UTM]] to harmonise the multi level warnings. We'd now like to wrap up this project by completing the single issue templates and tidying up the {{cl|User warning templates}}. To achieve this, one of the areas that needs greater community involvement is the redirecting of the old templates to the new ones. This is not something we will undertake lightly as a few editors are still attached to the old templates, though the majority of warnings being issued now are with the new system. If you have an opinion on the user warnings templates old or new, we'd appreciate your thoughts [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_user_warnings#Overview_-_Now_time_to_finish|here]] please.

== Persistent multi-page spamming by [[User:Reader contributor]] ==

Persistent spamming of link to websites which s/he is the marketing director for past final spam warning.  S/he has been spamming links to commercial websites with objectionable amounts of advertising that s/he is the marketing director for [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Reader_contributor&oldid=105029557]. The links have been removed multiple times by multiple independent editors. If this isn't the textbook definition of [[WP:SPAM|spamming]], as well as a violation of [[WP:COI]], and [[WP:EL]], I don't know what is. Per [[WP:AN]] persistent spammers should be reported to [[WP:AIV]]. This spammer has been given appropriate warnings, and persists past {{tl|spam4}} which indicates that blocking is appropriate for continuing to spam after the warning.  However, despite everything which points to spamming, an admin thought it was a content dispute, and thought the report would be better handled here. [[User:Leuko|Leuko]] 05:42, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

--In view of the fact that I am being harassed here... I would like to appeal to all those concerned editors to broaden or better yet understand the situation before anything should be posted. If what I've done is spamming... Do you really consider it as such upon totally reviewing what had happened. How would we say then that Wikipedia will soon be a realiable source of information when in fact some of its editors and administration are itself biased. How would you say then that it is indeed a fact when the only basis of ones decision pertains to 'I think'. Users and indeed users! editors are indeed editors! administrators are indeed administrators! But what if the situation involves administrators, editors, and users who are trying to despose a contributor. A contributor who does not use his position to promote the sites he/she is handling, as what is being JUDGED, but indeed just using a page of the sites he/she is handling to better give an informative information to the topic and in this issue an internal link is being used inorder to show what the content of the link is. If you judge it as spamming when you provide an information to help wikipedia in providing information to various readers then be it called as such. For those who had already judged it... Have you read, review, and understand the very content, quality, information of the SITES used. have you then used you're sense of Human Understand to read, review, and understand the very content, quality, information of the SITES or you just used your 'I think' sense of judgement or you have  totally used the Guidelines to be in control of the situation. Guidelines are just suppose to be GUIDELINES! If you think it is to be removed so because of the fact that the sites have stores on it, have you read the link I posted and where it is being redirected, have you read the page personally? Does it point to a store? NO!!! it points to the RELATED TOPIC I used in adding various contents in the page. Upon seeing that the sites have stores have you seen the thousands of pages containing the meaningful and Informative articles or should I say Informative contents. If none or some of these are true... from where do you belong? [[User:Reader contributor|Reader contributor]] 06:42, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
:I am sorry, I don't understand some of what you write, but yes, I have looked at the page.  That is how I determined it was spam, since it contained an objectionable amount of advertising, and no useful, unique information or content beyond what would be included in the WP article if it reached FA status.

A one-week block might not be incorrect, depending on the circumstances.

:I don't know why people are saying this is a questionable block; I'll take a look at the 3RR report again.

So this business of him being a good editor punished unfairly because of past wrongs is a wrong-headed way of looking at it.

::Tamilnation is a mixed collection.  It is true that the editor of the website was quite involved in the ethnic conflict and I think he now supports the LTTE.  But if you leave Sri Lankan politics there are also many reliable materials on the website like this translation of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea by W.H. Schoff[http://www.tamilnation.org/heritage/periplus.htm] and this paper by R.E. Frykenberg[http://www.tamilnation.org/conferences/cnfMA66/frykenberg.htm].

As for Frykenberg's paper, I am sure there should be many sources other than tamilnation.  Sagepub should have it.  Or, it certainly should be available in a library.

(unindent) It is true that we need reliable sources. However, [[WP:NPOV]] also has one important sentence, that seems to get overlooked:  
{{cquote|The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these should be presented fairly.}}
Unfortunately, there are many borderline reliable sources in the Sri Lanka conflict, and discussions of whether they are RS or UnRS have not reached consensus in the past.  (Only one reliable news agency - BBC - sends reporters to Sri Lanka, and they can't be everywhere.) 
However, [[WP:NPOV]] even has a solution for that: Section [[WP:NPOV#A simple formulation]] recommends: "Alternatively: '''assert facts, including facts about opinions — but do not assert the opinions themselves.'''" (bold in original.)

Tamilnation is notable. According to Alexa.com, (as of January) Tamilnet has a reach of 22/M users. By contrast, defence.lk, the main site for pro-GoSL information about the civil war, has only 6.5. (By comparison, our Sri-Lanka related articles have about 2/M. This is based on the assumptions that we have 400 articles related to the Sri Lanka conflict and thet they are about as visited as the average WP article; both assumptions might rather be a bit high.)  

Therefore, we can not simply ignore Tamilnation. One possible solution is as follows:

Based on the recommendation in section [[WP:NPOV#A simple formulation]], the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Sri Lanka Reconciliation|WikiProject Sri Lanka Reconciliation]], a bipartisan effort to improve collaboration on and coverage of the Sri Lankan Civil War, has come up with a recommendation to use references to quote Tamilnet only as their opinion, and with the attribution "pro-rebel". (See [[WP:SLR#Classification of sources]]). This is a compromise that has been reached in consensus, which is quite an achievement for two factions who are so utterly at odds! 

Anybody who has a better idea how to solve this in a way that can be agreed by both Sinhalese and Tamils, please come forward. We'd love to hear your ideas. &mdash; [[User:SebastianHelm|Sebastian]] 21:11, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:''The policy requires that, where there are or have been conflicting views, these should be presented fairly.''

:Yes.  If there are conflicting views presented in various '''''reliable sources''''', ''then'' all those views should be presented fairly.  But quoting verbatim from an apologist's pamphlet and to call it 'presenting fairly' is nonsense.  The problem here is this.  Both sides have a POV.  And in each POV, the other is a 'terrorist'.  So if we can get any RS which echoes both these POVs, then both POVs should be presented.  If however, Reliable Sources echo only one of the POVs, then ''only'' that POV should be presented.  The other POV <u>should NOT be presented</u> regardless of how many non reliable sources exist to vouch for it.  And Tamilnation, because of its blatantly partisan nature in all matters concerning Tamil ''and'' the fact that the site is ''only'' about Tamil and nothing else, is NOT a reliable source.  Ranking high on Alexa means nothing.  It doesnt change the fact that it is a biased and partisan source.  Period.

:So, the solution?  Solution is simple.  Delete every claim from each one of those articles that doesnt have the backing of a [[WP:RS |'''reliable source''']].  Thats all. [[:User_talk:Sarvagnya|Sarvagnya]] 21:40, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

:: OK, sorry, I realize what I wrote may not fit so well to this article.

:::{{cquote| And Tamilnation, because of its blatantly partisan nature in all matters concerning Tamil ''and'' the fact that the site is ''only'' about Tamil and nothing else, is NOT a reliable source.}}
:::So if a source discusses only Tamil then we should not use that as a source??? Thats odd. Is this new rule made on-the-fly will be applicable to every sources? Because I have a long list of sources such as ourkarnataka.com, karnatakavision.com, karnataka blah blah.com. and loads of crappy books written by 'historians' which discusses only karnataka and of partisan nature. Then articles related to some language/region will not have any sources (rather unfortunately). 
:::Just to remind: this discussion is regarding edit war caused by (1) removing external links, (2)removing cited materials, (3)adding frivolous tags etc. 
::::(1) The tamilnation.org link was used as '''External link''' not '''reference'''. And the article linked to was not related to LTTE at all; it was a '''reproduction of a research''' paper (with numerable citations).

===How to cite material from Tamilnation===
The material from Tamilnation is not original material by anyone associated with Tamilnation. It is paper publshed in a conference  where peer reviewed paper are presented by reputable authors of the field. Wiki cite has a way tocite such material that is not directly available.

====Option 1====
ref cite web
*| title = XXXXXXXXXX
*| work = Quoted from the the Conference........, [[1983-08-29]]
*| publisher = Tamilnation, USA
*| url = http://www.tamilnationorg/.....  /ref

====Option 2====

== Mike Church and legal/personal threats ==

<p align=center>{{usercheck|1=Mike Church}}</p>
I blocked about 15 of [[:Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Mike Church|Mike Church's sockpuppets]] yesterday, and he responded today with this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Rspeer&diff=115586677&oldid=114146895 thinly veiled legal and personal threat]. I quote: "''It's good to keep listing his purported sockpuppets, despite the fact that one provably wrong one could set this whole website at the epicenter of a major lawsuit and destroy your reputation. I'm sure he'd be willing to do much worse to you, and I don't even want to imagine these possibilities.''"

I haven't gotten much help on this issue, and in particular I've had no response at all from the admin noticeboard. Blocking Mike's sockpuppets and reverting his sneaky vandalism needs to be a distributed job.

Here are some ways to start:
* Put the user pages in [[:Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Mike Church]] on your watchlist. Often, one of the first things he does with a new sockpuppet is alter the block messages on one of his previous incarnations. Sometimes you can then find other sneaky vandalism he made with the same account.
* Watch topics Mike fixates on, such as [[AutoAdmit]], [[Prestige (sociology)]], his online handle [[pensive]], [[174 (number)]], [[Brian Leiter]]...
* Look at the 2005 Mike-tracking page [[User:Isomorphic/Minions of the Church]] -- this may give you more of an idea of his modus operandi.

And please respond if you're willing to do this. [[User:Rspeer|'''<span style="color: #63f;">r</span><span style="color: #555;">speer</span>''']] / [[User talk:Rspeer|<span style="color: #555;">ɹəəds</span><span style="color: #63f;">ɹ </span>]] 17:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

::If not ''per se'' a legal threat, it's certainly about as close to it as you'll find short of "I WILL SUE U IN A COURT OF LAW IN TRENTON NEW JERSEY!", and even worse appears intended to have a chilling effect.

:::The sad thing is, Mike Church is pretty good at creating this chilling effect. At least three administrators who once tried to stop him don't bother anymore.

I just want to know that someone -- or better, many people, so that they don't all have to have as much time to waste as Mike does -- is going to continue the job.

== Copy and paste merges from deleted articles ==

:::As I understand it, the section of policy only applies to AFD's in progress. AFD's since deleted can recreate sections of their deleted material into another article. For instance if the article on George W. Bush's dog is deleted, the attribution remains in the first page's history, and the information simply can be added into the G.w.b. article instead. This happens all the time on AFD. Why is this a problem? But anyway, J.Smith brings up a very easy solution, we'll just undelete the article and make it a redirect, problem solved.

Especially if there's an ongoing pattern, it couldn't hurt to keep a closer eye on that sort of account, I think. But I'd agree, it doesn't necessarily indicate any foul play -- some people may be incoming from other wikis, may finally be registering after a long period of anon editing, or a few other benign explanations. As with kinda "iffy" usernames, it can (and sometimes should) attract our attention, but provided they make good edits, it doesn't seem a pressing problem. Only exception to that, I think, is if they're an abusive sockpuppet. &ndash; <span style="font-family: Garamond">[[User:Luna Santin|<font color="#1E90FF">'''Luna Santin'''</font>]] ([[User talk:Luna Santin|talk]])</span> 03:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

Hi

I'm rather new, so I wasn't sure whether I should outright remove an image or report it first. On [[Simon Gipson]], there are two photos. One has the caption 'Simon Gipson (left)'. This is ridiculous because the figure on the left of the photo sort of looks like Kermit the Frog.

After the second time I reverted his edits, I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jeffvll&diff=115887296&oldid=115689561 left a comment] on his talk page to ask him to discuss the change at the article talk page before adding the image again. Yet he re-added it again today. What's the proper procedure here? It's not breaking the 3RR if I understand it correctly - is it instead regarded as vandalism? I'm unsure. --[[User:Strangnet|Strangnet]] 09:42, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

:It's not vandalism by any reasonable standard. Vandalism is any deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia, and absent that purpose it's not vandalism.

In an e-mail I received from Ed, he wants me to indefblock his account because the user {{userlinks|Soothsayer.03}} (mentioned somewhere on these boards concerning spamming through the Wikimedia software) knows his passwords and whatnot.

[[User:Ed]] is requesting that his autoblock is lifted, which was caused by [[User:Soothsayer.03]] being blocked indefinately (see the talk page for the reasoning), I'm not sure if I'm buying it [[User:ryanpostlethwaite|Ryanpostlethwaite]] [[Special:Contributions/ryanpostlethwaite|contribs]]/[[User talk:ryanpostlethwaite|talk]] 00:25, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

Can a checkuser be performed to see if Ed's IP has changed to a different location in the past day or two? If it's in the same area, that won't tell us very much that we don't already know, but if it's in a very different location, then we'll know that it's likely compromised.

:According to WHOIS, the IP used by Soothsayer.03 was coming from Naperville, Illinois and Ed says he's from Chicago which they are relatively close, so the account being compromised is highly unlikely unless the other person who compromised it lives in his general area. According to Ed's talk page, he says Soothsayer.03 was at his house, and says she abused his e-mail or something he was unaware. I would unblock the autoblock and watch the account for a while. — [[User talk:Moe Epsilon|<font color="000000">Moe</font>]] 02:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

I couldn't find DeMoines University any where and the medical school has no faculty of education.

:::::I guess I needed the irony alert, huh? I was being sarcastic about '''Sue Rangell's''' credentials. That is the user page that misspells Des Moines University, and claims that Sue Rangell is on the faculty of education of a school that, as I noted, appears not to have any "faculty of education." What I called the "obvious phony" was a link to John C. Nesbit's impressive web page hosted by Simon Fraser University, with his photo and a few scores of publications. So, yes, I thought that the situation was so clear that I could jokingly refer to Nesbit as the phony instead of Rangell. I must remember never ever ever to be ironic in an online venue. Sorry.
