The '''Master of the Horse''' was (and in some cases, still is) a position of varying importance in several European nations.

==Magister Equitum (ancient Rome)==

The original Master of the Horse (Latin ''Magister Equitum'') in the [[Roman Republic]] was an office appointed and dismissed by the [[Roman Dictator]], as it expired with the Dictator's own office, typically a term of six months in the early and mid-republic. The Magister Equitum served as the Dictator's main [[lieutenant]]. The nomination of the Magister Equitum was left to the choice of the Dictator, unless a ''[[senatus consultum]]'' specified, as was sometimes the case, the name of the person who was to be appointed. The Dictator could not be without a Magister Equitum to assist him, and, consequently, if the first Magister Equitum either died or was dismissed during the Dictator's term, another had to be nominated in his stead.

The Magister Equitum was granted a form ''[[imperium]]'', but at the same level as a [[praetor]], and thus was subject to the ''imperium'' of the Dictator and was not superior to that of a [[Roman consul|Consul]]. In the Dictator’s absence, the Magister Equitum became his representative, and exercised the same powers as the Dictator. It was usually but not always necessary for the man nominated as Magister Equitum to have already held the office of Praetor. Accordingly, the Magister Equitum had the insignia of a praetor: the [[toga|toga praetexta]] and an escort of six [[lictors]]. The most famous Master of the Horse is [[Mark Antony]], who served during [[Julius Caesar]]'s first dictatorship.

After the [[Constitution of the Roman Empire|constitutional reforms]] of [[Augustus]], the office of Dictator fell into disuse, along with that of the Magister Equitum. The title ''magister equitum'' was revived in the late Empire, when [[Constantine I]] established it as one of the supreme military ranks, alongside the [[Magister Peditum]] ("Master of the Foot"). Eventually, the two offices would be amalgamated into that of the [[Magister Militum]] ("Master of the Soldiers").

The title [[Constable]], from the Latin ''[[comes stabuli]]'' or count of the stables, has a similar history.

==Master of the Horse (United Kingdom)==
{{see also|List of Masters of the Horse}}

[[File:MasterOfTheHorseUn.jpg|thumb|Dress uniform of the Master of the Horse.]]The Master of the Horse in the [[United Kingdom]] was once an important official of the [[British monarch|sovereign]]'s household, though the role is largely ceremonial today. The master of the horse is the third [[Court appointment|dignitary of the court]], and was always a member of the [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] (before 1782 the office was of [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] rank), a [[peerage|peer]] and a [[privy council]]lor. All matters connected with the [[horse]]s and formerly also the [[hound]]s of the sovereign, as well as the [[stable]]s and [[coachhouse]]s, the [[Stud farm|stud]], [[mews]] and previously the [[kennel]]s, are within his jurisdiction. The practical management of the [[Royal Mews|Royal Stables]] and stud devolves on the chief or [[Crown Equerry]], formerly called the [[Gentleman of the horse|Gentleman of the Horse]], whose appointment was always permanent. The [[Clerk Marshal]] had the supervision of the accounts of the department before they are submitted to the [[Board of Green Cloth]], and was in waiting on the [[Monarch|Sovereign]] on state occasions only. Exclusive of the [[Crown Equerry]] there were seven regular [[Equerry|equerries]], besides extra and honorary equerries, one of whom was always in attendance on the Sovereign and rode at the side of the royal carriage. They were always officers of the [[army]], and each of them was on duty for about the same time as the lords and [[grooms in waiting]]. There are still several [[Page of Honour|pages of honour]] who are nominally in the master of the horse's department, who must not be confounded with the [[Page (servant)|page]]s of various kinds who are in the department of the [[Lord Chamberlain]]. They are youths aged from twelve to sixteen, selected by the sovereign in person, to attend on him at state ceremonies. At the Coronation they assisted the groom of the stole in carrying the royal train.

The current Master of the Horse is [[Samuel Vestey, 3rd Baron Vestey]].

Today the Master of the Horse has a primarily ceremonial office, and rarely appears except on state occasions, and especially when the Sovereign is mounted. The [[Crown Equerry]] has daily oversight of the [[Royal Mews]], which provides vehicular transport for the Sovereign, both cars and horse-drawn carriages. Train travel is arranged by the Royal Travel Office, which also co-ordinates air transport.

The Pages of Honour, who appear only on ceremonial occasions, and the [[Equerry|Equerries]], were nominally under the authority of the Master of the Horse. The former are now controlled by the [[Keeper of the Privy Purse]]. The latter are effectively independent, and are functionally closer to the Private Secretary's Office. There are now three equerries to the Sovereign, and a larger number of extra equerries - usually retired officers with some connection to the [[Royal Household]]. The extra equerries are rarely if ever required for duty, but the Equerries are in attendance on the Sovereign on a daily basis. For some years the senior [[Equerry]] has also held the position of [[Deputy Master of the Household]]. The permanent equerry is an officer of [[major]] rank or equivalent, recruited from the three armed services in turn. Many previous equerries have gone on to reach high rank. The temporary equerry is a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] of the [[Coldstream Guards]], who provides part-time attendance. When not required for duty he has additional regimental or staff duties. Senior members of the [[Royal Family]] also have one or two equerries.

==Grand Squire of France==
{{main|Grand Squire of France}}
In [[France]] the master of the horse, known as the '''[[Grand Squire of France]]''' ('''Grand Écuyer''', or more usually '''Monsieur le grand''') was one of the seven [[Great Officers of the Crown of France]] from 1595. As well as the superintendence of the royal stables, he had that of the retinue of the [[King of France|sovereign]], also the charge of the funds set aside for the religious functions of the court, [[coronation]]s, etc. On the death of a sovereign he had the right to all the horses and their equipment in the royal stables. He oversaw personally the "Great Stable" ("grande écurie"). Distinct from this officer and independent of him, was the first equerry (''Premier Ecuyer''), who had charge of the horses which the sovereign used personally (''La petite écurie''), and who attended on him when he rode out. The office of master of the horse existed down to the reign of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Under [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] the duties were discharged by the first equerry, but under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] and [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] the office was revived with much of its old importance.

==Oberststallmeister (Germany)==
In [[Germany]] the master of the horse ('''Oberststallmeister''') was a high court dignitary; but his office was merely titular, the superintendence of the Emperor's stables having been carried out by the ''Oberstallmeister'', an official corresponding to the crown equerry in England.

==Caballerizo mayor (Spain)==
{{main|Caballerizo mayor}}
The '''[[Caballerizo mayor]]''' was the Officer of the [[Royal Household and Heritage of the Crown of Spain]] in charge of the trips, the mews and the hunt of the King of [[Spain]]. 

The Office of “Caballerizo mayor” was one of the main Offices of the Royal Household in charge of the Royal Stables and everything related to the transportation of the Monarch. When the King sorted out from the Royal Palace, the Caballerizo had the main position behind him and the major rang over the other Court Officials. He managed as well the stables, the carriages and the horses. He was assisted by the “Primeros Caballerizos” (First Equerries) who were nominated by him.

He was in charge of the Royal hunt as “Montero mayor” (Great Hunter) holding, in many cases, the “Alcaldias” (Majorships) of the [[Spanish royal sites]].

==Papal Master of the Horse==<!-- This section is linked from [[Vatican City]] -->
The Master of the Horse, Cavallerizzo Maggiore, or Hereditary Superintendent of the Stables of the Palaces, was a hereditary position held by the [[Marquess Serlupi Crescenzi]]. The office was a Participating Privy [[Chamberlain of the Sword and Cape]], in the [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Pontifical Household]]. It was abolished in the reforms of the [[Papal Curia]] of 1968.

==Riksstallmästare (Sweden)==
The holder of the title ''Riksstallmästare'' (''Master of the Horse of the Realm'') in Sweden was not one of the [[Great Officers of The Realm]], but rather one of the [[Lesser Officers of The Realm]]. He was the superintendent of the Kings Stables and of the realm's [[stud farm]]s. As such he was important in military matters, and often he had a tight connection with the army, and then especially with the army's [[cavalry]] units.

==Equerry (Russia)==
''Konyushy'' ([[Russian (language)|Russian]]: ''Конюший'') is literally translated as Master of the Horse or Equerry.

Konyushy was a [[boyar]] in charge of the [[stable]]s of [[Russia]]n rulers. It was a high title at the [[court]] of Russian rulers until the 17th century. By the end of the 15th century a special Equerry Office (конюшенный приказ, "konyushenny [[prikaz]]") was introduced, headed by the Konyushy. It was in charge of the [[Tsar]]'s stables, parade equipage, ceremonies of court ride-offs, and military horse breeding. At one point [[Boris Godunov]] was konyushy. The Equerry Office handled a significant amount of Tsar's treasures, related to [[Horse tack|harness]] and horse/horseman [[armor]], which were transferred to the [[Kremlin Armoury]] in 1736.

==Equerry (Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania)==
"''Koniuszy''" (corresponding to the [[English language|English-language]] "Equerry" or "Master of the Horse") was a position of [[nobility]] known in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1138–1320)|Kingdom of Poland]] from the 11th century, and in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] from the15th. A ''koniuszy'' had charge of the stables and herds of a [[Grand Duke]] or [[Monarch|King]]; in reality, it was a ''podkoniuszy'' (sub-equerry), subordinate to the ''koniuszy'', who had the more direct responsibility.

From the 14th-16th centuries, a "koniuszy" was a dignitary (''dygnitarz'') in the [[Polish Kingdom]] and in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

== Georgia ==
In the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], the similar post was known under the name of ''amilakhvari'' (''amir-akhori'', lit.: Prince-Master of the Horse), derived from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. It was a deputy to the commander-in-chief (''amir-spasalari'') and a member of the royal council. From the 1460s to the Russian annexation of Georgia (1801), the office was hereditary in the [[Amilakhvari|Zevdginidze-Amilakhvari]] family.

==Asia==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Similar posts were common in the imperial courts of China (See [[Sima (surname)|Sima as a Chinese surname]]) and Japan, the royal courts of Korea, and elsewhere in East Asia. The Siamese [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|kingdom of Ayutthaya]] had a Master of the Royal Elephants.
