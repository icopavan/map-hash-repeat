==Statement of the dispute==
''This is a summary written by users who are concerned by this user's conduct. Users signing other sections ("Response" or "Outside views") should not edit the "Statement of the dispute" section.''
* The user has engaged in disruptive editing of [[Railpage Australia]], POV pushing, reverting edits that remove non-notable people and links to unencycopedia sources.
* Unilateral reverts to a non-consensus version.

=== Desired outcome  ===
''This is a summary written by users who have initiated the request for comment.  It should spell out exactly what the changes they'd like to see in the user, or what questions of behavior should be the focus.''

* Unilateral reverts to a non-consensus version.

=== Evidence of disputed behavior ===
(Provide diffs. Links to entire articles aren't helpful unless the editor created the entire article. Edit histories also aren't helpful as they change as new edits are performed.)

* Repeated reverts of edits removing non-notable people and unencyclopedia sources.

* The user has openly stated he does not believe the article should exist and campaigned for its deletion in a recent AfD. The AfD decision having been '''keep''' the user has engaged in disruptive editing to devalue the content by adding unencyclopedia content, and "warning" that the article could be nominated for deletion again ''for'' containing unencyclopedia content.

Myself both as 203.28.90.133 and my logged in account have witnessed and had dispute with this user. It has been documented with evidence that he is strongly anti the subject of the article, which has resulted in a NPOV approach with negative results.  He also seems to attract a number of IP socks for vandalism (see the history on this page and the Railpage Australia talk page).  In my view, this user seems to reject anything that he feels may have the subject of the article viewed in a positive light, and is unwilling to compromise.

Oh dear, 

Is this what you get when you challenge a group of individuals associated with Railpage?

Could this be classified as Wiki Bullying?

I have not posted anything defamatory, I've always tried to debate the matter with no personal attacks on other Wiki users (although I have edured some), and I have refrained from making further edits about the "controversy" since the articles for deletion was to keep. I accepted the umpires decision.

The only edits (aside some from citation required[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Railpage_Australia&oldid=113921260]) made since the vote deletion was to keep was to add what I consider to be well known New South Wales based rail identity to the Railpage article.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Railpage_Australia&oldid=114041262] 

My last edits were to return the article back to what administrator Golden Wattle made on the 10th of March 2007. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Railpage_Australia&oldid=114141032].

As for removing removing unfavorable comments from my talk page. Guilty, I wasn't aware that was a crime.

Stand by for the chant of the mob that will appear here in the following days by those associated with the opposing point of view with the Railage article and anonymous I.P address Wiki users.

:Hardly a NPOV from RPWebslave and The null device [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Railpage_Australia]. 
:When did you try to resolve this dispute with me? As another Wiki user has said on the Railpage, I was not the orginator of the orginal edit. I only put it back up (along :with some others] after it was deleted.

:Anyway like I said before, I accepted the umpires decision regarding that matter.

:Okay, the real reason for this Wikipedia Kangaroo Court, me editing the article with the notability of one Craig Dewick amongst Railfans in :NSW[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Railpage_Australia], I did the following quick search.
:1. Column 8, Sydney Morning Herald[http://www.smh.com.au], November 27 2002, Craig and his website get a :mention.[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/26/1038274300121.html]

:what was probably the very first NSW Railway bulletin board service waaaaaay back in 1991" [http://www.het.org.au/links.htm]

:4. He gets a mention on Neetys website, another well know Sydney (female) rail gunzel. [http://www.railpage.org.au/neety/trains/raillinks.html]

:I failed to mention in my first response, it would have been polite to inform me of this "Requests for comment" surely it is there is a Wiki guideline saying it is preferable to :inform the person concerned?  [[WP:RFC]]
:I only found out about it by a weak anonymous posing on aus.rail[http://groups.google.com.au/group/aus.rail/browse_thread/thread/53cecc4b3179c022/d67d60e37bc7b7dd?hl=en#d67d60e37bc7b7dd]. A concidence maybe? seems some people run with the fox and :hounds.
[[User:Tezza1|Tezza1]] 08:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)


I would have thought the Fabian strategy was sucessfully used by the supporters who wish to retain that article.

The outcome of the whole episiode is as follows, if you want an wikipdeia article non matter how un-encyclopedic it is, get together 15 or so of your mates together as supporters and overide any opposition.

SHOCK HORROR!!! are some having another go? This is nothing more than a content dispute over one users[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:The_Null_Device] editing style [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Railpage_Australia&action=history], WP:COI and behavior [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard].[[User:Tezza1|Tezza1]] 11:18, 25 July 2007 (UTC)

Again? Why don't people convey their views to my on my talk page according to guidelines first? this is nothing more than a content dispute, I have always argued my point of view on the Railpage discussion page, based with online sources supporting my case. 

----


This recent dispute is the result of myself calling the Railpage Forum, "Commercial". It clearly is, as the Forum in question is owned by a Australian registered corporate entity and not a non-profit organisation according to Australian Taxation Office guidelines[http://www.ato.gov.au/nonprofit/content.asp?doc=/content/34267.htm&page=3&H3]. I have even tried to accommodate people in dispute, editing the article "Commercial- Yes, free membership, voluntary payment for service"[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Railpage_Australia&oldid=145515883].

I suppose my complaint about the "flood" of editing by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:The_Null_Device The_Null_Device] has also contributed to this RFC becoming active again.

I really don't know why people involved in or supporting an organisation create an article and then expect it to remain subject to no scrutiny. When you create an article here it becomes PUBLIC PROPERTY!!!. If you don't want people to edit your article then don't create it!!!!!

==Outside view==
''This is a summary written by users not directly involved with the dispute but who would like to add an outside view of the dispute. Users editing other sections ("Statement of the dispute" and "Response") should not edit the "Outside Views" section, except to endorse an outside view.'' 

{Add summary here, but you must use the endorsement section below to sign. Users who edit or endorse this summary should not edit the other summaries.}

==Outside view by KieferSkunk==
I am an uninvolved third party reading the article and Talk history on the affected page.  We received a notification of Tezza1's behavior on [[WP:WQA#User:Tezza1 disruptive editing pattern|Wikiquette Alerts]], and I took it up and reviewed the recent edit history.  Without knowing all of the history here, and going strictly on what is currently visible on the Talk page, I see evidence of several things that I believe warrant further investigation:

*Violations of [[WP:CIVIL]], [[WP:NPA]], [[WP:POINT]], and possibly [[WP:COI]] and [[WP:3RR]].
*Treading on thin ice with regard to [[WP:LEGAL]].
*Repeated rejections of community consensus.
*Statements against other editors that attempt to intimidate them into changing their stances.
*<s>Suspected sockpuppetry involving the accounts [[User:DFC_Free_Oz]] and [[User:FailpageMustGo]].</s>
*<s>Repeated attempts to nominate the article for deletion during the dispute - nominations were rejected as being in bad faith.</s>
**Further analysis determined that sockpuppetry was unlikely between Tezza1 and the referenced accounts.
*Statements of intent to continue disrupting the article.

I have advised other editors to remain civil during the content dispute, and to not engage in personal attacks.  However, it is my belief that the majority of editors in this dispute do have a clear consensus on the article, and Tezza1's tactics have been disrupting and unnecessarily poisoning the atmosphere there.  While I am not in any authoritative position, and I am not a content expert with respect to the article itself, these are my statements based on what I see from an outside perspective.  Thank you.

== Outside view by Golden Wattle ==
I have had limited involvement with the Railpage article. It strikes me that the editors most involved there are not involved with other areas of the Wikipedia.  I suggest that raising this RfC is premature.  There has been for example no attempt to discuss the issues with Tezza1 on his talk page, surely a basic entry point for dispute resolution. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tezza1&curid=9649399&action=history history of the page] where there is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tezza1&diff=110728223&oldid=110302872 only one edit] from the IP address claimed to be that of the user raising this dispute, ie User:RPWebslave. 

I believe the users involved need to review the steps in [[Wikipedia:Resolving disputes]] including
:1 Avoidance
:2 First step: Talk to the other parties involved
:3 Second step: Disengage for a while
:4 Further dispute resolution
::4.1 Informal mediation
::4.2 Discuss with third parties

We seem to have jumped far too quickly to step 4.2. --[[User:Golden Wattle|Golden Wattle ]] <sup>[[User_talk:Golden Wattle|talk]]</sup> 19:00, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

== Outside View by johnmc ==
Whilst I have had some involvment with the Railpage article, and debated Tezza1 on some talkpage points, I consider myself to be an outsider in this specific case.  For the most part, I agree with Golden Wattle in that a RFC is premature, with some specific observations on my behalf. (If this is not the correct format for a page such as this, please advise me, and I will edit or remove them as required.):
# Whilst I am curious as to Tezza1's motives - I would be interested as to whether there is any [[Fabian_strategy|Fabian]] strategy behind his edits, considering that he was strongly in favour of deleting the article - I don't see him as being particularly disruptive to the article.  I would draw everyone's attention to the mysterious {{user3|208.113.160.21}}, whose ''jihad'' style reversions precipitated the entire protected article/AfD affair. (Take note of the comments in the talk page - this is an individual who believed that they were completely justified in their actions, even to the point of requesting that wiki admins remove the word "defamatory" from their "reason for block" text.  Also - of more recent vintage - is {{user3|Anti Fundie}} who apparently created their account for the main purpose (until finally receiving an indefinite block) of vandalising articles with contributions by David Bromage.  '''These''' are examples of disruptive editors.  As far as I can see, that while Tezza1 has been a thorn in the side, he has stuck by the rules.  And as long as he sticks to those rules, he should be free to contribute to the Railpage article.  As other editors have pointed out, Tezza1's article criticisms - whatever motive they were made for - have served to strengthen the article.  As a real life [[Devil's advocate]], Tezza1's contributions would help defray further accusions of pro-Railpage bias, and bolster the articles defences against the inevitable 3rd AfD.
