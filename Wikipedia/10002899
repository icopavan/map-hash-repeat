when i type something into the search bar a list of all searches Ive made apperas below it. This is quite bothersome how can i stop this from happening?

* In Internet Explorer, click Tools -> Internet Options..., click the Content tab, click AutoComplete and there are options there. Uncheck the box for "forms" (and "Web addresses" and "User names and passwords on forms" if you want) and click "Clear Forms".
* In Firefox, to disable the feature go to Tools -> Options..., in the Privacy section, click the Saved Forms tab and uncheck "Save information I enter in forms and the Search Bar" and click OK and then click Tools -> Clear Private Data... and make sure Saved Form Information has a tick and then click Clear Private Data Now.

Could this article please be made more secure? 
It concerns a highly controversial project that has been the subject of considerable scholarly debate in many publications in the fields of music and education. Some contributors have attempted to provide a balanced depiction of pro and con arguments regarding this project. Examine previous versions of this page and you will find lists of references to relevant books and articles as well as an explanation of opposing views. However, someone - presumably directly associated with the project - has repeatedly deleted everything and simply posted what essentially amounts to a propagandistic advertisement supporting the project. Today, once again, that is what has been posted on this page.

== How do I write this article if no "respected" sources exist. ==

There is an article on the software "Vodei Multimedia Processor" that I have worked on. Factual information is being removed because it isn't published or on a website that is considered credible.

I am writing things that the reader only needs to investigate themselves. I've even listed step-by-step instructions and uploaded screenshots to show that the software does, indeed, cost money and that there are a few other questionable attributes about the software (not the least of which is, why would anyone encode with their software?).

Can you help me in figuring out how to write this article without having a procession of people remove it completely citing wikipedia policy?

== Charles Upham Memorial Cavalry Champions Belt. ==

My question is, Is an ongoing history of a sporting competition a suitable article for inclusion as a Wikipedia subject. There is currently no written history of this prestigeous competition. 
The Cavalry Champions Belt is New Zealand's second oldest sporting competition, started in 1872 and renamed the Charles Upham Memorial Cavalry Champions belt in 1985, following the death of Sir Charles Upham, VC and Bar.
I wish to write an ongoing history of the Belt with brief information about each of the winners.
My intention is to add information as it comes to light and as time produces more Champions.

I don't see any problems with this, except to be careful to avoid [[WP:OR]]. If there is currently no written history of this competition, it may be difficult to find reputable sources as references for the article, which may lead to problems. BTW, if you wish to have a look at a possible format for such an article, a comparison with something like [[Chatham Cup]] (NZ's top soccer tournament) may be informative.

== Searching for the use of a term within articles when the term is the title of an article ==

How can one search for the use of a term within articles without being redirected to the main article about the term?

It would be very helpful to do this when rooting out vandalism spamming by commercial entities. For example, I watch the article [[Benjamin Britten]]. In the past, I have removed commercial links from the page to the [[Find A Grave]] website and the website for [[Naxos records]]. I was clear from looking at histories that users had created accounts or used anon accounts to add these links to a number of pages. However, especially when IPs are used, it may not be possible to track down all instances of such spamming just from user histories.

When a non-notable organization spams in this way, you can simply search for the orgs name and get a list of articles in which its mentioned. However, both [[Naxos]] and [[Find a Grave]] are notable enough to have their own articles - searching simply directs me there, so the main article acts as a sort of "search shield" for any spamming they may do in other articles.

Is there any way to get around this?

[[User:Dybryd|Dybryd]] 08:33, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
*Actually, [[Find A Grave]] isn't spam. I sometimes link to them as they're a pretty useful resource in their field and multiple veteran users and non-spammers link to it, just like we often link to IMSB. Full text searching can't be done with the Wikipedia search engine, you can use a restricted Google search instead. As for finding links: [[Special:Linksearch]]. - [[User:MacGyverMagic|Mgm]]|[[User talk:MacGyverMagic|<sup>(talk)</sup>]] 08:46, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
*Click on "Search" instead of "Go" (which is activated by pressing enter) to search for articles containing the search term. [[User:PrimeHunter|PrimeHunter]] 12:50, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

==Ipswich School==

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have been informed that the entry for Ipswich School is offensive and should be removed. It mentions pupils by name and makes a number of unfounded comments about the school's reputation.

I would appreciate some contact from those who edit the content to explain their policy as regards schools and the protection of pupils from bullying.

I would also like the page removed, please.

:The offensive material has been removed. Our experience shows that material such as this is almost always added by pupils of the school itself so they are probably the people you wish to speak to.

Hi Wikipedians:

I want to download a page with Plucker, but Plucker seems to be unable to generate a home page from Wikipedia -- I am guessing because the Wikipedia is not HTML.

Also, if possible I would like to use Plucker to pluck linked pages as well to a depth of two pages only (including the home page).  Can this be done?

Please let me know.  If we cannot write about who we are, perhaps we need to ask that the article be totally deleted.  The first edition of the article certainly did not reflect at all who we are or what we wish to be said about ourselves.
