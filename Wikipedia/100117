'''Marvin the Martian''' is a character from the [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoons. 

==Conception and creation==
Animation director [[Chuck Jones]] noted that [[Bugs Bunny]] soon began to outwit [[Yosemite Sam]] (the creation of the senior director, [[Friz Freleng]]), so he decided to create the opposite type of character; one who was quiet and soft-spoken, but whose actions were incredibly destructive and legitimately dangerous. Marvin the Martian made his debut in 1948's ''[[Haredevil Hare]]''.

Also unlike the other villains Marvin can be actually evil at most points, and not just daft. However he is a funny cartoon character like the other villains. Marvin is the quietest out of the villains, he is also soft-spoken, but also unlike most of the other villains he is very clever. 

Marvin's design was based on a conception of the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. "That was the uniform that Mars wore – that helmet and skirt. We thought putting it on this [[ant]]-like creature might be funny. But since he had no mouth, we had to convey that he was speaking totally through his movements. It demanded a kind of expressive body mechanics."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Korkis|first=Jim|title=The Return of Duck Dodgers|journal=Outré|page=25|volume=1|issue=7}}</ref>

Marvin was never named in the original shorts (though he was called the '''Commander of Flying Saucer X-2''' in ''[[The Hasty Hare]]'' in 1952), but decades later when the character attracted merchandising interest, the current name was selected.

===Voice Actor portrayal===
In his first appearance he was voiced by Mel Blanc who gave him a nasal-like voice, but later, Mel adopted an accent resembling [[Received Pronunciation]] for the character. Marvin was voiced in recent years by [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Bob Bergen]], [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]], and [[Eric Bauza]]. However, [[Sterling Holloway]] was suggested for Marvin's voice.

==History==
{{see|List of Marvin the Martian cartoons}}
Marvin hails from the planet [[Mars]], but is often found elsewhere. He is often accompanied by his dog "[[K-9 (Looney Tunes)|K-9]]", and sometimes by other creatures (one gag, first used in ''[[Hare-Way to the Stars]]'' (1957), being candy-sized "Instant Martians" that become full-size on addition of drops of water).

Marvin wears a [[Roman empire|Roman]] soldier's uniform, with old-fashioned basketball shoes. The style of these resembles the [[Chuck Taylor All-Star]]s brand name, considered to be the "generic" or "standard" basketball sneaker. His head is a black sphere with only eyes for features. The crest of his helmet appears, with the [[broom|push-broom]]-like upper section, to comically resemble an ancient Greek [[hoplite]]'s or a Roman Centurion's helmet. The appearance of the combination of Marvin's head and helmet allegedly led to Bugs Bunny thinking he was a "bowling ball wearing a spittoon" in one Looney Tunes animated short. Marvin speaks with a soft, English aristocratic accent, and often speaks [[technobabble]]. The helmet and skirt that surround him are green and his suit is red (in a few of the original shorts, his suit was green). He is also known for his trademark quotes "Where's the kaboom? There was supposed to be an earth-shattering kaboom!", "Isn't that lovely?", and "This makes me very angry, very angry indeed."

On numerous occasions, Marvin has tried to destroy the [[Earth]] with his "Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator" (sometimes pronounced "Illudium Pu-36")<ref> Differences of opinion exist regarding the correct pronunciation; Chuck Jones rendered the modulator's name as Q-36 in print in ''Chuck Amuck : The Life and Times of an Animated Cartoonist'' (New York: Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1989; ISBN 0-374-12348-9), p. 213.</ref>.  Marvin always laboriously over-pronounces the name of the device, which resembles a mere stick of [[dynamite]], in order to avoid any possibility of confusing it with some other similar technology<ref>Adamson, Joe (1990). Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare. Henry Holt. ISBN 0-8050-1855-7.</ref> Marvin attempts to destroy the Earth because, he reasons, "it obstructs my view of [[Venus]]"; he has been trying to destroy the Earth for more than two millennia, suggesting that members of his species, and possibly martian creatures in general, have extremely long lifespans. The original reference to "[[Uranium]] Pu-36" changed to "Illudium PU-36" in subsequent cartoons [http://www.gargaro.com/marvinsounds.html]. Marvin is consistently foiled by Bugs Bunny. He has battled for space territory with [[Daffy Duck]], ''a.k.a.'' ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century]]''.

He has appeared in three animated shows on [[Cartoon Network]] &mdash; as a 3 year old toddler in ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'', as a primary villain in the ''[[Duck Dodgers]]'' television series, and most recently in ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]''. In "Baby Looney Tunes", he is picked on by the other babies (except Taz) for being "weird", as he is too shy to speak to them, before they befriend him upon seeing how helpful he is, and later in songs. In "Duck Dodgers", he works for the Martian Queen, [[Queen Tyr'ahnee]]. This show reused his original name from ''The Hasty Hare'' (although the opening credits list him as Marvin playing Commander X-2, in the same way as Daffy is playing Duck Dodgers). Marvin the Martian appears in "The Looney Tunes Show" episode "Reunion" and appeared in the short "I'm a Martian", voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]. Here, he is described as a former classmate of Daffy's who has been plotting to destroy Earth since graduation. The episode also has a flashback, in which it is revealed that the yellow headdress on the top of his helmet is actually his hair, showing that in high school (before he started wearing the helmet) he kept it down. Over a decade prior to any of these, he guest-starred in a ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' segment titled "Duck Dodgers Jr.", where he was accompanied by an apprentice named [[Marcia the Martian]]. He was also in a ''[[Taz-Mania]]'' episode and did a cameo in ''[[The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries]]'' ("What's the Frequency, Kitty?"). Marvin also made appearances on ''[[Animaniacs]]'', notably in the [[Mindy and Buttons]] short subject, "Cat on a Hot Steel Beam" (which also featured the [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot|Pussyfoot]]) and in "Star Warners", along with his dog K-9. 

Marvin has also appeared in a number of video games. He served as the main antagonist in both the Mega Drive/Genesis game ''[[Taz in Escape From Mars]]'' and the Super Nintendo game ''[[Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions]]''. He also appeared in ''[[Bugs Bunny Lost in Time]]'' for PlayStation where he was the boss of Dimension X, and in the final level of ''[[Sheep, Dog, 'n' Wolf]]''. He was a common enemy in the Quantum Beep stages of ''[[Road Runner's Death Valley Rally]]'' for Super Nintendo. He also made a brief cameo in the 2003-2007 [[Fridays (Cartoon Network)|CN Fridays]] intro.

Marvin was also cast as the referee in ''[[Space Jam]]'' (though he did not stay to referee the whole game due to Bupkus beating him up), and then later had a major villainous role in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' where he was hired by the ACME chairman, [[Looney Tunes: Back in Action|Mr. Chairman]] ([[Steve Martin]]), to finish DJ ([[Brendan Fraser]]) and the gang at Area 52. In the film's climax, he reappears to bring the Blue Monkey diamond to the ACME satellite, but is thwarted by Bugs (who he duels in a parody of [[Obi Wan Kenobi]] and [[Jango Fett]] in ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'') and Daffy (who arrives as [[Duck Dodgers]] to save Bugs after he is exhausted from the battle), resulting in Marvin trapped in a bubble floating through space.

Marvin appeared in the Looney Tunes version of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', ''[[Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas]]'' as an employee at Daffy Duck's "Lucky Duck Super Store". Marvin was homesick for his planet, Mars, and wanted to go back for Christmas (but also mentions that he's planning to destroy the Earth as well). At first, Daffy doesn't let him take Christmas off, since he expects the employees to work on Christmas Day. After being visited by the abrasive yet well-intentioned Christmas ghosts, Daffy is redeemed, and as part of a surprise Christmas celebration, gives Marvin a rocket that will go faster than the speed of light, allowing him to make it to Mars by yesterday.

In nearly all of his appearances, Marvin is shown using a small pistol that fires either bubbles of pliable plastic or energy beams. He is also apparently immortal or long-lived, since he mentions doing over two thousand years of research to create the Illudium Q-36 Space Modulator, and he is seen in ''[[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century]]''.

'''Jobs'''

1. In older Looney Tunes episodes Marvin is unemployed; later he does secret missions for the M3 Squad.

2. In Looney Tunes, the Movie, he is an evil villain working for the Chairman.

3. In the Duck Dodgers series he is a Martian commander/super villain for the queen.

4. In one Duck Dodgers episode he is demoted to slave boy as punishment. 

5. In the new Looney Tunes show he makes pizzas and helps deliver them.

6. In Looney Tunes Christmas he puts prices on products in a super store, until the end of the film when he is promoted to assistant manager.

7. Marvin was the referee in Space Jam.
