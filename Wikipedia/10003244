'''[[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]]''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|m|ɪ|n|iː|ˈ|æ|p|əl|ɪ|s}}) is the largest [[city]] in the state of [[Minnesota]] in the [[United States]], and the [[county seat]] of [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]].

==Neighborhoods==
The city is divided into communities, each containing neighborhoods. For example, the [[Near North, Minneapolis|Near North]] community is composed of the [[Hawthorne, Minneapolis|Hawthorne]], [[Jordan, Minneapolis|Jordan]], [[Near North (neighborhood), Minneapolis|Near North]], [[Sumner-Glenwood, Minneapolis|Sumner-Glenwood]] and Willard-Hay neighborhoods.

Mayor Rybak and the city have engaged five local "Great City Design Teams" for massive city-wide landscaping projects including parks, signage and streetcars. A Web site was registered in June 2007 to the City of Minneapolis for this purpose although it bears the name and insignia of the Minnesota chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. The first six projects involve [[Washington Avenue (Minneapolis)|Washington]], [[Nicollet Avenue|Nicollet]], Penn, Lowry, Central and Lyndale Avenues, and 18th, 40th and 46th Streets.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Washington Boulevard Great City Design Team|date=|author=|publisher=American Institute of Architects Minnesota (domain registrant: City of Minneapolis)|url=http://www.thenewwashingtonblvd.com/}} and {{cite web|title=a vision study for the new WASHINGTON BOULEVARD|date=2007-06-12|author=Mayor R.

==Government and politics==
{{Expand section|date=March 2007}}

The [[Minneapolis City Council]] holds the most power and represents the city's thirteen districts called [[ward (politics)#United States|wards]]. The council has twelve DFL members and one from the [[Green Party of Minnesota|Green Party]]. [[R.T. Rybak]] also of the DFL is the current [[List of mayors of Minneapolis|mayor of Minneapolis]].

==Crime==
{{main|Minneapolis Police Department}}
The early years of the city were noted for crime. 150 brothels operated in hotels and candy stores earning the city $50,000 annually in 1900 dollars. Two historical figures are remembered in particular. Four-term mayor [[A.A. Ames|"Doc" Ames]] turned the [[Minneapolis Police Department]] into [[organized crime|organized criminals]] who directed swindlers, pickpockets and burglaries. Ames earned income from [[prostitution]], 45% of the profit from a stacked game of poker, and $15,000 a year from slot machines. During [[Prohibition]], [[Kid Cann]] processed what some estimates say was 600 gallons of liquor per day and by 1933 had made himself a nationally known [[bookmaker]]. Shortly after this time, depleted forests and a drop in the price of iron ore in northern Minnesota, loss of the seat as milling capital of the country to [[Buffalo, New York]], and cheap water transport combined into an economic downturn and drop in crime. Since 1950 the city lost 150,000 people and lost much of downtown to urban renewal and highway construction, resulting in a "moribund and peaceful" environment during the second half of the 20th century.<ref name=Moskowitz>{{cite web

During the 1990s the [[murder]] rate climbed. After 97 people died in 1995, people called the city "Murderapolis," a T-shirt slogan mentioned by [[The New York Times]] when reporting that Minneapolis had nearly 70% more murders [[per capita]] and had surpassed the annual number of homicides in New York City.<ref name=NYT-Johnson>{{cite web

By 1998 the overall rate of major crime dropped by 16 percent, the department's largest one year improvement in two decades, and continued to drop for seven more years until 2005.<ref name=MPR-legacy>{{cite web

Politicians debate  the causes and solutions, from improving on the lack of police officers caused by balancing the city's budget, to providing youths with alternatives to gangs and drugs, to helping families in poverty. For 2007, the city invested in public safety infrastructure, hired over forty new officers, and has a new police chief, Tim Dolan.<ref name=MPR-Williams-Scheck>{{cite web

'''([[Consul General]])''' - A consul general heads a consulate general and is a consul of the highest rank serving at a principal location and usually responsible for other consular offices within a country.

'''([[Consulate]])''' - The office of a Consul is termed a Consulate, and is usually subordinate to the state's main representation in that foreign country, nowadays usually an Embassy or High Commission usually in the capital city of the host nation.
