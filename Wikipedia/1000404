'''Ed the Sock''' is a [[puppet]], created and voiced by [[Steven Kerzner]], that became a [[Canada|Canadian]] television personality in the 1990s, best known for his appearances hosting programming on [[MuchMusic]] and his own talk show, ''Ed's Night Party'', later renamed ''[[Ed & Red's Night Party]]''.<ref>[http://entertainment.ca.msn.com/tv/article.aspx?cp-documentid=24230678 Ed the Sock brings his wisecracks back to TV] The Canadian Press, May 13, 2010 (Article by Bill Brioux)</ref> Ed the Sock has a scowl, a [[cigar]] sticking out of his mouth and a rough, gravelly voice.

==History==
=== Early years ===
Kerzner was a producer in the 1990s at Newton Cable,<ref>[http://tvguide.ca/Watercooler/Guilty%20Pleasures/Articles/100603_ed_sock_timeline_JO The rough life of Ed the Sock] TV GUIDE, 2010-06-03 (Article by Janine Oliveira)</ref> during this time the show went through several co-hosts which included [[Harland Williams]], [[Eric Tunney]] and [[Tim Rykert]].  After Newton Cable was purchased by [[Rogers Cable]] in 1993, Kerzner was able to repackage the program for a wider cable audience with Ed the Sock as the star.

The new show attracted the interest of producer John Brunton, who took the program to [[CITY-TV]].  This show, co-hosted by "Humble" [[Howard Glassman]] (better known as half of the local radio morning show [[Humble & Fred]]), debuted on February 10, 1995, at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time.  Brunton later departed the show after having some creative differences with Kerzner.

Kerzner was also a political aspirant, running unsuccessfully as a candidate for [[school trustee]] and for the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] in the [[Ontario general election, 1990|1990 Ontario provincial election]]. A fiscal and foreign-policy conservative, Kerzner's political heroes at the time included [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]]. In recent years, however, he has offered left-of centre views, arguing in favour of rights for same-sex couples, care for the homeless and other causes. He has since stated in a 2009 interview that he is no longer a conservative.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/article/612131 Sock it to me!

=== Ed's Night Party and other projects ===
[[File:Ed-&-Red's-Night-Party-Logo.png|150px|thumb|right|The logo of ''Ed & Red's Night Party'']]
Besides ''[[Ed's Night Party]]'', which aired in countries around the world including the [[United States]] (late night on the [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]] Network), Ed was a fixture on [[MuchMusic]]. The show was in the late-night slot because of its overt depictions of sexuality, primarily involving sexualized women and Ed's off-colour remarks. Among Ed's shows were ''Ed's Big Wham Bam'', a weekly live two-hour program; and the annual ''[[Fromage]]'', a program which featured and mocked the cheesiest [[music videos]] released in the year, which Ed began hosting in the late 1990s, following former host and ''Fromage'' creator, MuchMusic VJ [[Christopher Ward (songwriter)|Christopher Ward]]. Ed also hosted a popular but short-lived series in which he and guests watched and made fun of bad movies called ''[[Ed's Nite In]]''.

Ed was joined on ''Ed's Night Party!'' by [[Liana K]]  (Liana Kerzner, wife of Steven), a [[buxom]] and [[busty]] [[Red hair|redhead]] who became Ed's first female co-host and his most popular one, and who also is featured in a pin-up calendar, which was offered on Ed's official website. For several years, Liana has been the senior producer and writer of all Ed's projects. With the addition of Liana as co-host, the show was renamed ''[[Ed & Red's Night Party]]''.

''Ed & Red's Night Party'' ended its CITY-TV run on August 31, 2008. Creator Steven Kerzner stated that, while the weekly TV show was ending, the character would likely live on in other projects that were already in the works.<ref name="edfinal">{{cite news |work=Toronto Sun |title=Citytv socks it to Ed |url=http://torontosun.com/Entertainment/Television/2008/06/25/5976996-sun.html |date=June 25, 2008}}</ref>

=== Return to television ===
[[File:ThisMovieSucks!-Initial-Hosts.png|150px|thumb|''This Movie Sucks!'' as seen in the first episode]]
After two years off the air, Ed returned to television on [[CHCH-TV]] [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]<ref>[http://www.mediaincanada.com/articles/mic/20100727/chch.html CHCH expands programming for fall] Media in Canada, July 27, 2010 (Article by Katie Bailey)</ref><ref>[http://www.thespec.com/news/business/article/251528--chch-tv-tweaks-format CHCH-TV 'tweaks' format] THE HAMILTON SPECTATOR, August 26, 2010 (Article by Steve Arnold)</ref> with a new show ''[[This Movie Sucks!]]'' which is similar to his old show on City-TV, ''Ed's Nite In''.

==Inspirations==
Ed is based on two actual people, whose names remain undisclosed.  

Some people contend that it inspired the creation of Ed's American counterpart [[Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog]]. The controversy dates back to 1997 when Ed agreed to appear on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. The appearance was suddenly cancelled, and one to three months later, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog debuted.<ref>[http://www.bureau42.com/view/7667/this-movie-sucks-discussion “This Movie Sucks” Discussion] bureau42.com, July 11, 2010</ref><ref>[http://publish.uwo.ca/~sjohn7/edthesock.htm Is Triumph just a poor man's Ed the Sock??]</ref> Ed afterwards expressed such resentment towards Triumph that NBC (the network that aired O'Brien's show) stated they "didn't want Ed anywhere near Triumph" when Conan visited Canada for a week of shows during February [[2004]].<ref>[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=ed+the+sock Ed the Sock] Everything 2, Originally posted on June 19, 2008.

==Other appearances==
[[File:Steven-Kerzner-Ed-The-Sock.png|150px|thumb|Steven Joel Kerzner playing Ed the Sock]]
Aside from television, Ed has had some radio appearances<ref>[http://www.friendsoftheargonauts.com/talk/content.php?136-Ed-The-Sock-Headlines-This-week%92s-edition-of-The-Sports-Guys Ed The Sock Headlines This week’s edition of The Sports Guys] January 21, 2011</ref> and is a popular guest at numerous sci-fi conventions. Among his many appearances, he and [[Liana K]] hosted the first ever Constellation Awards in 2007.<ref>[http://constellations.tcon.ca/2007.shtml 2007 Constellation Awards Archive]</ref> He also was an [[advice columnist]] for ''Faze Magazine'' in 2001 and 2002.<ref>[http://www.fazeteen.com/ed/index.html ASK ED & RED...] Faze Magazine</ref>

With other performers in the Toronto community, Ed is a sponsor of and will be appearing at a brand new convention called [[Futurecon]], for New Year's Eve 2010.<ref>[http://futurecon.wordpress.com/ Futurecon]</ref>

Since June 23, 2011 both Ed and Liana have been hosting ''Ed & Red's Podcast'' for gwmp.tv.<ref>[http://gwmp.tv/tvfilm/edthesock Ed & Red's Podcast] gold water moving pictures</ref>

== FU Party ==
Shortly before the start of the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011 federal election]], Ed announced his intention to run for the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] as head of the new "Fed-Up Party". The FU Party's stated goals include fighting apathy and stupidity in government.<ref>[http://www.edthesock.com/fu.gif Ed the Sock for Prime Minister - TV Legend announces new party to fight apathy & stupidity] Ed the Sock Website, March 23, 2011. Retrieved March 29, 2011</ref> Throughout the campaign the "FU Party News Centre" posted links to various articles and videos trying to encourage people to vote and criticizing the political establishment, especially the government and re-election campaign of [[Stephen Harper]]. Around this time, Ed also started his own [[WordPress]] [[blog]] called "Nobody's Puppet!" where he elaborated his thoughts on politics but also on the media industry.

Ed declared victory for the FU Party on April 28, 2011, citing that he had successfully assailed apathy after the record turnout at advance polls, and because to him the "Orange Surge" showed that Canadians had learned that they have a choice. While not officially endorsing the [[New Democratic Party]], Ed stated that the "NDP has become the FU vote" and as such withdrew from the race. While the election did grant the NDP a record number of seats in Parliament, actual [[Voter turnout in Canada|voter turnout]] was not much higher than in [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008]], which helped the governing [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] to win the majority of seats.<ref>[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/low-voter-turnout-monday-helps-deliver-conservatives-coveted-053803721.html Low voter turnout Monday helps deliver Conservatives' coveted majority] The Canadian Press, May 3, 2011</ref> Ed stated he hopes the FU Party will continue to provide "smartass commentary for a dumbass political establishment." It should be noted that Fed-Up was purely a [[joke political party]] and was never registered with [[Elections Canada]].
