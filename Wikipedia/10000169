It currently houses 450+ in the elementary, and 400+ in the Junior/Senior High School. Their school mascot is known as "Crownie" and their team name is the Regals.

==School History==

In the early days of the school each day began with a mass and a rosary.<ref>Information for this section was taken from Regina Yearbooks, 1959 - 2010</ref> In 1960 the Senior Class President was James R. Langenberg. The yearbook for this period was called "Harvest," while the newspaper was called "The Spectrum." Regina also had a fall carnival similar to the current-day Fall Fun Festival called the Blue and Gold Carnival. In 1971 hallway moderators were present in the hallways at each passing period. This same year the Blue and Gold Carnival was held indoors and included the cake walk, the football throw, basketball shoot, fishing pond, and penny pitch. The hayrack ride, pony rides, and public auction were held outdoors. On Senior Skip Day the seniors went to the Palisades. In 1972 Regina held its first outdoor graduation with Jim Schwob as Valedictorian. The senior class enjoyed their Skip day at Lake Okoboji. In 1973 the dress code was changed to allow for jeans. This was also the first year that public busing was made available for Regina students. In 1981 Regina held its first ever Fall Fun Festival, a tradition carried on today. Regina raised over $45,000. Current Regina High School Principal David Krummel graduated in 1987. In 1992 the seventh-grade class went on a retreat to Spring Brook, a tradition that continued until 2006, when the Class of 2011 was not allowed to go. In 1994 Regina hosted a drunk driving reenactment was staged to dissaude the student body from drinking. Then in 1995 Regina hosted a large student hunger drive. During this same year Operation Smile, an organization devoted to raising money to fix children's cleft palates, began a club at Regina. The chess team, led by Fareyd Bonnet, won the state competition and earned a spot in the national tournament in California this same year. In 1997 Regina did not have a Homecoming parade due to the fact that streets usually closed off were being used to redirect traffic around the First Avenue detour. Then in 1999 Cathy Gehris came to Regina to head the lunch program with 12.5 years of experience working at the University of Iowa Hospitals.

==Building History==

In 1959 Regina High School was built.<ref>Information for this section was taken from Regina Yearbooks, 1959 - 2010, and from plaques around the building.</ref> In 2004 the Regina Community joined together to raise money for a new addition to the school. They succeeded in raising the minimum $5,000,000 by raising a grand total of $5,010,000 and later being given a $500,000 from an anonymous donor. In 2005 Regina added a new addition at the expense of part of their back parking lot. This new building contained an elevator and a brand new cafeteria. The old cafeteria was turned into an art room and a brand new band room for Tom Nelson. However this new addition was great had many problems that became a pain for some teachers in the building. such pains were windows leaking, water leaking, air conditioning problems, heating problems, and not having any window blinds to keep out the sun on hot days.They then made a new car-line circle after they built on the previous one.

===Football===
====2000====

This was the first year for head coach Kevin Miller. Miller, a Solon graduate, took over the job from Matt Mitchell who turned around the Regina program with a 12-6 record over two years along with a share of the district title. Miller, a master motivator, made big changes in the Regina Weight Program. He also brought the Wishbone offense to Regina.
*At Mid Prairie- W 25-6
*Cleer Creek Amana- L 2-31
*Colombus- W 27-13
*At Montezuma- W 28-0
*At Pekin- W 14-7
*Cardinal- W 35-8 *Homecoming
*Wapello- W 28-8
*At Iowa Valley- L 0-34
*At West Branch- L 16-24
The Regals finished the season 6-3 overall and 5-2 in the district, falling just one win short of the playoffs. An upset of rival West Branch in the final game of the season would have secured the Regal playoff spot but they lost a hard fought game 16-24. After the season ended, coach Kevin Miller left Regina for his alma mater Solon High School.

====2001====

This was head coach Chuck Evan’s first year after taking over the program from Kevin Miller. He had his work cut out for him as the Regals returned only 3 starters from the 2000 team that went 6-3. Because of their undersized offensive and defensive lines, the Regals struggled to run the football consistently all season.
*Mid Prairie- L 14-35
*At Clear Creek- L 7-34
*At Colombus Junction-
*Montezuma- L 20-38
*Pekin- L 14-47
*At Cardinal- W 39-6
*At Wapello- L 7-35
*Iowa Valley- L 6-38
*West Branch- W 21-7
The Regals finished the season with a 2-7 record overall and a 2-5 record in the district but the highlight of the season was a 21-7 victory over rival West Branch in the last game of the season. This was a huge victory for the Regals and gave them some momentum going into the 2002 season.

====2002====

This was the second season for coach Chuck Evans and the Regals had their sights set on the playoffs. Coach Chuck Evans said “We played a lot of young kids last year, but it’s paying off two-fold. I know the kids better than I did last year coming in at the end of June. And I’m keeping the same system on offense and defense, which is helping them learn quicker.”
*At Mid Prairie- L 0-34
*Clear Creek-L 8-19
*BGM- W 34-6
*At Cardinal- W 21-6
*At Pekin- L 7-25
*Colombus- W 38-8
*Montezuma- L 0-49
*At Wapello- W 34-0
*At Waco- L 7-21
Regina ended the season with a 4-5 record overall and a 4-3 record in the district. It was a tough year for the Regals as they missed the playoffs again. Riley Lehman was named first team all area linebacker, Marshall Kloos was named second team all area offensive line, Sean Cavanaugh was named second team all area linebacker, and Robert Gaffey was named second team all area defensive line. Chris Tang and Mike O’Connell were named all area honorable mention.

====2003====

They dominated their next three opponents, CCA, BGM, and Cardinal with a combined score of 128-34. Their fifth game they lost to Pekin 21-7. They came out in their last four games and went 4-0. They beat Columbus Junction and went on to play 10th ranked Montezuma. They won 12-9 in overtime upset win. They played Wapello and their last game against WACO was a close win 24-20. They were beat to the playoffs by Mid Prairie who beat them early on in the season. Head coach Chuck Evans was voted Coach of the Year along with Daniel Murray as Kicker of the Year.

====2004====

The 2004 Regina Football team played their first game against Mid Prairie, one of their two loses last season, and shut them out 19-0. Senior Jacob Gilroy had never beat Mid Prairie in his football career. He said it meant a lot to him because it meant a lot to coach Evans to finally beat them and shut them out. The Regina defense held the Hawks to only 102 yards and 7 first downs. They came out and dominated CCA 45-14. The 3rd week’s game of the week was between Regina and West Branch. West Branch came out at their home field and won 13-16. They had a late touchdown in the second half to take the lead and win. Regina won their next four games with a consecutive score of 136-29. Their eighth game was another Game of the Week, against Pekin. Daniel Murray kicked a field goal at the end of the 4th quarter to win 17-14. Regina made it to the playoffs after last year missing it by inches. Their first game they beat Starmont 13-12. In the quarterfinal game at home, Regina played West Branch but this time Regina came out on top 23-7. Regina’s last game of the season was the semi-final game for the State 1A Championship.

====2005====

The 2005 Regina High School Football team won the 1A State Title. This was the first year that the Regals made it to the State Title Game since 1972. The Regals went 12-1 with their only loss to West Branch High School costing the Regals a District Championship. In the Regals first playoff game they stopped the battering ram offense of Starmont High School. The Regals won their first playoff game 14-0 with the help of their staunch defense led by Junior Adam Martensen, the Press-Citizen District 6 Defensive Player of the Year. The second game of the playoffs pitted the Regals against rival school West Branch. The Regals avenged their regular season loss to the Bears by beating them 21-0. The hallowed “Hail Murray Pass” led the Regals to their semi-final victory over Dike-New Hartford. Daniel Murray caught a Hail Mary pass from Quarterback John Bothell with 18 seconds left in the 4th quarter. This pass was coined the “Hail Murray Pass” by the students at Regina High School. The Regals made it to the State Championship game and didn’t have the major adrenaline rush at the end of the game. They won 19-8 against Algona-Garrigan to give the Regals their first State Title.

With a returning group of great athletes the Regals played an undefeated regular season. The highlight of the season in many peoples minds was a win against longtime rival West Branch at the Little Rose Bowl in West Branch. Marv Cook returned to his alma matre leading a Regal team that was though by everyone to be a underdog. But Regina struck early and often beating West Branch hanily 41-7. The other high point was after beating a solid Pekin team the last game of the year 17-0 and having the first undefeated season in a few years at Regina, and marking the new coching staffs first undefeated season. After a first round victory at home against Bellvue 45-0, Regina traveled to North East Gooselake in what could be compared to the ice bowls of Green Bay. In below freezing temperatures with winds blasting the field the Regals beat a very stout NE Gooslake team despite star Jake Reisen's injury. This 16-6 victory secured a semi final round game against Mason City Newman Catholic High School in the UNI Dome.
