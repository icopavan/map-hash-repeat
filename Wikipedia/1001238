This is a '''list of English language [[small press]]es''', small publishers, current or past, that have published (printed) works of fiction and nonfiction, poetry, short stories, essays, pamphlets, limited edition or collectible [[Private press|books]] and [[chapbook]]s, and other forms of literature. In addition to publishing few books per year, the [[print run]]s of their titles are often smaller than for books from larger publishers. This list does include periodic publishers of poetry, and literature journals and magazines, including [[Alternative comics|alternative]] comic books. This list does not include exclusively online publishers, academic publishers (who often publish very limited print runs, but for a different market), or businesses operating solely as printers, such as [[print-on-demand]] companies or [[vanity press]]es.
