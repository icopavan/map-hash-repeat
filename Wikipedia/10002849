:: I've made a comparison table at [[User:Pomte/Bullets]]. In Firefox/Opera both middot and sdot look like squares, but you imply above that sdot is a circle, in IE? I can't check in IE right now.

:::I too am using Firefox, and even in your table sdot shows up on my screen as a circle, regular sdot about the same size as small bull, while middot shows up square. However, on the local public library PCs, with IE, sdot is the hollow-square-or-rectangle of "unknown-character", while hardcoded "•" shows up properly. Accordingly, I've updated usercheck to use "•" instead of sdot; and just now have done the same for smallbullet. I think the probem is that some computers use fonts that simply have nothing defined for whatever their browsers are trying to convert sdot into. I'm not happy about changing from an HTML tag to a hardcoded character, but I need to find out what will work across all platforms. I may end up using small-small-bull-/small-/small. I won't know for sure until I can get a broad sampling of results. -- [[User:Ben|<span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''">'''''Ben'''''</span>]]&ensp;<small><sup>[[User talk:Ben|'''TALK''']]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Ben|'''HIST''']]</sub></small> 04:36, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
::::I am using Firefox 1.5. Increased past a certain font-size, sdot and bold middot start looking exactly the same, except sdot appears vertically low off-center. They also appear as rectangles in IE 5.5 regardless of hardcoding. An important question that I forgot to ask is why aren't you using {{tl|·}} (bold middot) instead? I don't know if there is consensus on this, but{{·}} it{{·}} seems{{·}} to{{·}} be the most reasonable size, and its documentation provides reason for preferring it over other delimiters. Nesting two &lt;small&gt; tags is counter-intuitive, especially if substituted, though of course once the code starts getting complicated, the template should stop getting subst'd, as in the case of {{tl|·}}. –[[User talk:Pomte|Pomte]] 07:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::Usercheck -- {{usercheck|Mykungfu}} -- is a fairly long linklist even in Monobook skin with small default sanserif font and a hi-res screen... longer still in Classic skin with a larger serif font, or a lower-res screen. I'm trying to shorten it a trifle, and shrinking the separators was my preferred option. Abbreviating terms further, or using a smaller font throughout, would be less preferable, only because they'd make the linklist a little harder to read. I'm using Firefox 2.0.0.2, but I don't think that's the important thing; it's the font being used, and there are even different versions of common fonts, so the character set and spacing may differ from computer to computer even with the same browser/version: [[User talk:Ben#The HTML spaces in WP:AADD|'''example''']]. -- [[User:Ben|<span title="Formerly ''Benedict the Moor''">'''''Ben'''''</span>]]&ensp;<small><sup>[[User talk:Ben|'''TALK''']]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:Contributions/Ben|'''HIST''']]</sub></small> 08:40, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

:*'''Comment:''' Er, this is not applying good faith by assuming I am "hiding" things on purpose. Please explain how the old template has an advantage over the new one? The old one was a ''sidebar'' that made a mess of the articles that it was imposed onto. Not to mention that it was necessary to remove some names of followers when their followership wasn't authenticated, and seemed to have been indiscriminately added in the first place.
::The new template is a ''footer'' that neatly fits at the bottom of relevant articles and also provides links to more articles than the old one did. I don't see how keeping the old template will improve Wikipedia as there are links to [[syncretism]] and [[interfaith dialogue]] etc that have nothing to do with [[Sathya Sai Baba]]. The new footer has ''superseded'' the old sidebar. [[User:Ekantik|Ekantik]] <sup>[[User talk:Ekantik|talk]]</sup> 16:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
:::[[User:Ekantik|Ekantik]], Here someone fixed it [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sathya_Sai_Baba&diff=prev&oldid=114281312] and here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sathya_Sai_Baba&diff=prev&oldid=114437400] you removed it and mixed the information up again?!? What is one to think? Like I said in the template discussion prior, an encyclopedia should be user friendly and not confuse the reader. So, I still hold the position of keeping the old one in the event that this one only serves to confuse people. If I was looking to see if there were opponents I would be [[confused]] and think there weren't any if you have your way. There is also the risk of voting for the old ones deletion, may be viewed as an implied approval of you mixing up the information. It may fit neatly at the bottom where no one may look, or access to see that there are many other related article.  
:::So, as an act of good faith please pledge not to mix up the information. You first said/implied it couldn't be done or it could be done at a later date, then along came a little helper and Whala...it can be fixed. Then you reverted this editors work? As to "seemed to have been indiscriminately added", please provide a link where this was done and please don't just remove things.

::::*'''Comment:''' I'm afraid I don't find your arguments coherent, and I'd '''strongly''' advise you to [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] when dealing with other editors. It appears that you are a new editor to a controversial subject and you may not know of the history relating to such pages. Let me point it out again: ''I am the editor who created this template'', and while it is the wiki-way to have it edited by other editors, I'm still not convinced that it is helpful to separate followers and opponents. 
::::*You speak of my "reverting other people's work", do you think [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sathya_Sai_Baba&oldid=113715579 this] is an example of good editing? How about [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sathya_Sai_Baba&oldid=114281312 this]? In both cases the editor made no effort to remove the names of the opponents from the original section, thus creating '''duplicate entries'''. Yep, while it may have been a genuine oversight, it is still careless editing. I'm sure you cannot blame me for reverting even though I disagree with the separation in the first place. Furthermore if you choose to make edits that you ''know'' are controversial, you ''should'' discuss it first on the talkpage before proceeding to make edits.
::::*If a bunch of followers and opponents were grouped together as "Followers and Opoonents" how exactly would anybody be confused when all they have to do is '''click on the link to find out?''' An administrator has already opined that the new template is still too large which I agree with, and I don't think it is even necessary to list followers/opponents. 
::::*As for information being indiscriminately added, I am referring to the inclusion of [[interfaith dialogue]], [[syncretism]], [[Manmohan Singh]], [[Benjamin Creme]], [[Sri Sri Ravi Shankar]] and other questionable entries that have little or nothing to do with SSB. The purpose of this template is to connect all articles that ''deal directly with SSB-matters'' and not to insert anything indiscriminately. Perhaps you should take another look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:SathyaSaiBaba template] and think again about your words: "all mixed up is of little value and a case for less is more" and keeping the information in an accessible form. You can see that the original template is disjointed and has irrelevant entries in irrelevant categories, whereas the new template has categorised the connected articles properly with more to be added if and when they are created.
::::Like I say, I find your argument incoherent and I can't understand how you cannot see how this template greatly improves upon and supersedes the old one, but that's my opinion. Anyway that is a different subject altogether which should really be discussed at [[Template talk:Sathya Sai Baba]] instead of here. This is about whether the template should be deleted. It should, because it is a) redundant, and b) it is unnecessary. Regards, [[User:Ekantik|Ekantik]] <sup>[[User talk:Ekantik|talk]]</sup> 03:40, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' - Duplicate with [[Template:Sathya Sai Baba]]. Template seems excessive for purpose intended - a sidebar assumes certain screen resolutions, and may cause excessive scrolling requirements for those on lower resolutions.

The result of the debate was {{{1|}}} '''delete''' - the keep arguements are unconvincing.

* '''Keep!, Because:''' Although I agree with deleting this if it is kept in articles as a template call, the template CAN be very useful for editors or creators of multiple episode articles, ''if it is substituted''. Currently this requires [[Special:ExpandTemplates]], however, '''''I will alter the template''''' so that a) it can only be substed and b) when it is substed it comes out as just prose. Obviously, the decision to delete the template would go alongside removing it from all the articles it is in, which is what we'd have to do if I changed it to a subst-only version, too. So please keep the template, and I will fix it so that it is subst-only, which makes it useful without causing a template-for-content issue. --'''[[User:Alfakim|<font style="color:#4f87f9">Alfakim</font>]]'''-- [[User talk:Alfakim|<font style="color:#4f87f9">talk</font>]] 17:37, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
