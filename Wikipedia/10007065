The result was '''delete'''. There are arguments to merge, but they would be calling for merging to an article that was [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of characters in TimeSplitters series|also deleted in AFD]], so there is nowhere to merge to, as any merge would constitute a recreation of that article. --'''[[User:Coredesat|Core]][[User talk:Coredesat|<font color="#006449">desat</font>]]''' 01:53, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

* To the "merge" voters: I can't understand how you want ''all'' of these characters to be merged. I can understand a few of them that are both recurring and play roles in the storyline, but do you really want ''all'' of them merged? That's ridiculous; the main reason why I'm nominating most of these is because they're non notable and I guarantee you that if ''all'' of these characters are merged into a "list of characters" article, I will eventually nominate that one, in turn, if the non notable characters cannot be removed from the list.  ♣ [[User:Klptyzm|<font color="blue">'''Klptyzm'''</font>]]  <sup><font color="FF0000">[[User talk:Klptyzm|Chat wit' me]]</font>  '''§'''  <font color="FF1234">[[Special:Contributions/Klptyzm|Contributions]]</font></sup> ♣ 19:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
**How will having minor characters deteriorate the overall quality of the list? In fact, many lists are ''entirely devoted to'' minor characters, such as [[Minor characters in Seinfeld]] or [[List of minor characters on South Park]].--'''[[User:TBC|<font color="#007BA7">TBC</font>]]<big>Φ</big>[[User talk:TBC|<font color="#007BA7">talk?</font>]]''' 08:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
*** Ok, either you know ''nothing'' about the TimeSplitters series or you're a fanboy of the series, because many of these "minor character" lists list ''important'' minor characters; 90 % of these characters listed don't even appear in the ''storyline'', and, if they do, it's only once. Like someone said, most of these articles consist of only the descriptive paragraph found in the "gallery" section of the games, which are not neutral and in-universe and, unfortunately, that's the most you're gonna get out of them. In the end, merge is too generous. Delete this crap.  ♣ [[User:Klptyzm|<font color="blue">'''Klptyzm'''</font>]]  <sup><font color="FF0000">[[User talk:Klptyzm|Chat wit' me]]</font>  '''§'''  <font color="FF1234">[[Special:Contributions/Klptyzm|Contributions]]</font></sup> ♣ 14:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete all, hell no to merge''' - there are over one hundred character models in each TimeSplitters game, each one of these has a paper-thin one paragraph storyline and absolutely no significance whatsoever. A merged list of TimeSplitters characters would be a bloated and useless monstrosity, and an incomplete one at that, considering that only a couple dozen characters are covered here.

*'''Delete All''' per nom.  If one of the above merge voters would like to volunteer to merge them into a new, single article that'd be fine but I don't want to doom the closing admin to that much footwork so my opinion is a simple delete. [[User:Arkyan|Arkyan]] 17:04, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
