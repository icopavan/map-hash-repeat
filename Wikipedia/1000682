A '''[[cognition|cognitive]] radio''' is a [[transceiver]] that automatically changes its [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] or [[reception]] [[parameter]]s, in a way where the [[wireless communications]] can have spectrum agility in terms of selecting available wireless [[Channel|channels]] opportunistically. The main process is also called [[Dynamic spectrum management|dynamic spectrum management]]. A cognitive radio, as defined by the researchers at [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]], is "a software defined radio with a cognitive engine brain".<ref name="cognitiveradio.wireless.vt.edu">[http://www.cognitiveradio.wireless.vt.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=home home [CWT Cognitive Radios&#93;<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==History==
The concept of [[cognition|cognitive]] radio was first proposed by Joseph Mitola III in a seminar at KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, in 1998, published later in an article by Mitola and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr in 1999.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/98/17080/00788210.pdf?tp=&arnumber=788210&isnumber=17080 IEEE Xplore - Login<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was a novel approach in wireless communications that Mitola later described as:

<blockquote>The point in which wireless [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs) and the related networks are sufficiently computationally intelligent about radio resources and related computer-to-computer communications to detect user communications needs as a function of use context, and to provide radio resources and wireless services most appropriate to those needs.<ref name="mitola_dissertation">http://www.it.kth.se/~jmitola/Mitola_Dissertation8_Integrated.pdf</ref>
</blockquote>

Cognitive radio is considered as an ideal goal towards which a [[software-defined radio]] platform should evolve: a fully reconfigurable wireless transceiver that automatically adapts its communication parameters to network and user demands.

Regulatory bodies in the world (including the [[Federal Communications Commission]] in the United States, and [[Ofcom]] in the United Kingdom) found that most [[radio frequency]] spectrum was inefficiently utilized.<ref>[http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/mar04/3811 IEEE Spectrum: The End of Spectrum Scarcity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For example, [[cellular network]] bands are overloaded in most parts of the world, but many other frequency bands, such as military, [[amateur radio]] and [[Paging (telecommunications)|paging]] frequencies are not sufficiently utilized. Independent studies performed in some countries confirmed that observation,<ref>[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/49/20/21/PDF/paper9220_valenta.pdf Václav Valenta et al., Survey on Spectrum Utilization in Europe: Measurements, Analyses and Observations<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/9626/30419/01399240.pdf?tp=&arnumber=1399240&isnumber=30419 IEEE Xplore - Login<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/35/28504/01273768.pdf?tp=&arnumber=1273768&isnumber=28504 IEEE Xplore - Login<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and concluded that spectrum utilization depends strongly on time and place. Moreover, fixed spectrum allocation prevents rarely used frequencies (those assigned to specific services) from being used, even when any unlicensed users would not pose noticeable interference to the assigned service. Therefore, regulatory bodies in the world have been considering to allow unlicensed users in licensed bands if they would not cause any interference to licensed users. These initiatives have focused cognitive radio research on [[Dynamic spectrum management|dynamic spectrum assess]]. 

A first phone call over a cognitive radio network was made on Monday 11 January 2010 in Centre for Wireless Communications
at [[University of Oulu]] using CWC's cognitive radio network [[CRAMNET]] (Cognitive Radio Assisted Mobile Ad Hoc Network), that has been developed solely by CWC researchers.,<ref name = "About CRAMNET" >http://www.cwc.oulu.fi/home/files/news/CRAMNET_1.pdf</ref><ref name = "Article about worlds first phone call made in the GIGA seminar, January'2010">http://www.cwc.oulu.fi/home/files/news/CRAMNET_3.pdf</ref>

==Terminology==
Depending on the set of parameters taken into account in deciding on transmission and reception changes, and for historical reasons, we can distinguish certain types of cognitive radio. The main two are:

* '''Full Cognitive Radio''' ("[[Mitola radio]]"): in which every possible parameter observable by a wireless node or network is taken into account.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/srchabstract.jsp?arnumber=788210&isnumber=17080&punumber=98&k2dockey=788210@ieeejrns&query=%28%28mitola%29%3Cin%3Eau+%29&pos=5&access=no  J. Mitola III and G. Q. Maguire, Jr., "Cognitive radio: making software radios more personal," IEEE Personal Communications Magazine, vol. 6, nr. 4, pp. 13-18, Aug. 1999]</ref>
* '''Spectrum Sensing Cognitive Radio''': in which only the [[radio frequency]] spectrum is considered.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/srchabstract.jsp?arnumber=1391031&isnumber=30289&punumber=49&k2dockey=1391031@ieeejrns&query=%28haykin+%3Cin%3E+metadata%29+%3Cand%3E+%2849+%3Cin%3E+punumber%29&pos=0&access=no S. Haykin, "Cognitive Radio: Brain-empowered Wireless Communications", IEEE Journal on Selected Areas of Communications, vol. 23, nr. 2, pp. 201-220, Feb. 2005]</ref>

Also, depending on the parts of the spectrum available for cognitive radio, we can distinguish:

* '''Licensed Band Cognitive Radio''': in which cognitive radio is capable of using bands assigned to licensed users, apart from unlicensed bands, such as [[U-NII]] band or [[ISM band]].  The [[IEEE 802.22]] working group is developing a standard for wireless regional area network (WRAN) which will operate in unused television channels.<ref>[http://ieee802.org/22/ IEEE 802.22]</ref><ref name=Carl2009>{{cite journal

==Technology==

Although cognitive radio was initially thought of as a [[software-defined radio]] extension (Full Cognitive Radio), most of the research work is currently focusing on Spectrum Sensing Cognitive Radio, particularly in the [[TV]] bands. The essential problem of Spectrum Sensing Cognitive Radio is in designing high quality spectrum sensing devices and algorithms for exchanging spectrum sensing data between nodes. It has been shown<ref>http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/wireless/posters/WFW05_cognitive.pdf</ref> that a simple [[energy detector]] cannot guarantee the accurate detection of signal presence, calling for more sophisticated spectrum sensing techniques and requiring information about spectrum sensing to be exchanged between nodes regularly. Increasing the number of cooperating sensing nodes decreases the probability of false detection.<ref>[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/4234/30631/01413630.pdf?tp=&arnumber=1413630&isnumber=30631 IEEE Xplore - Login<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Filling free [[radio frequency]] bands adaptively using [[OFDMA]] is a possible approach. Timo A. Weiss and Friedrich K. Jondral of the [[University of Karlsruhe]] proposed a [[spectrum pooling]] system<ref name=autogenerated1 /> in which free bands sensed by nodes were immediately filled by [[OFDMA]] subbands.

Applications of Spectrum Sensing Cognitive Radio include [[Professional Mobile Radio|emergency networks]] and [[Wireless LAN|WLAN]] higher [[throughput]] and [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] distance extensions.

Evolution of Cognitive Radio toward [[Cognitive network|Cognitive Networks]] is under process, in which the concept of Cognitive Networks is to organize intelligently a network of Cognitive Radios.

=== Main functions ===
The main functions of Cognitive Radios are:<ref>[[Ian F. Akyildiz]], W.-Y. Lee, M. C. Vuran, and S. Mohanty, "NeXt Generation/Dynamic Spectrum Access/Cognitive Radio Wireless Networks: A Survey," Computer Networks (Elsevier) Journal, September 2006. [http://www.ece.gatech.edu/research/labs/bwn/surveys/radio.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/scc41/files/Communications_Magazine_article_on_SCC41.pdf Cognitive Functionality in Next Generation Wireless Networks <!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

* '''Spectrum Sensing''': detecting the unused spectrum and sharing it without harmful interference with other users. It is an important requirement of the Cognitive Radio network to sense spectrum holes. Detecting primary users is the most efficient way to detect spectrum holes. Spectrum sensing techniques can be classified into three categories:
** ''Transmitter detection'': cognitive radios must have the capability to determine if a signal from a primary transmitter is locally present in a certain spectrum. There are several approaches proposed:
***[[matched filter]] detection
***energy detection
***[[cyclostationary process|cyclostationary]] feature detection
** ''Cooperative detection'': refers to spectrum sensing methods where information from multiple Cognitive radio users are incorporated for primary user detection.<ref> Z. Li, F.R. Yu, and M. Huang, “[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5229125 A Distributed Consensus-Based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radios],” IEEE Trans. Vehicular Technology, vol. 59, no. 1, pp. 383-393, Jan. 2010. </ref>
** ''Interference based detection''.

*'''Spectrum Management''': capturing the best available spectrum to meet user communication requirements while not creating undue interference to other (primary) users. Cognitive radios should decide on the best spectrum band to meet the [[Quality of service]] requirements over all available spectrum bands, therefore spectrum management functions are required for Cognitive radios. These management functions can be classified as:
** ''spectrum analysis''
** ''spectrum decision''
The practical implementation of spectrum management functions is a very complex and multifaceted issue in itself, given that it has to address a mixture of technical and legal requirements. An example of the former is chosing appropriate sensing threshold to detect other users, while the latter is exemplified by the need to meet the rules and regulations set out for [[COST-TERRA|radio spectrum access]] in international (ITU Radio Regulations) and national (Telecommunications Law, etc.) legislation.<ref>[http://www.erodocdb.dk/Docs/doc98/official/pdf/ECCREP159.PDF CEPT Report 159 on technical and operational requirements for Cognitive Radio operation in TV White Spaces]</ref><ref>[http://www.cost-terra.org European Research project on spectrum access policies for Cognitive Radio]</ref>  

* '''Spectrum Mobility''':  is defined as the process when a cognitive radio user exchanges its frequency of operation. Cognitive radio networks target to use the spectrum in a dynamic manner by allowing the radio terminals to operate in the best available frequency band, maintaining seamless communication requirements during the transition to better spectrum.

* '''Spectrum Sharing''': providing the fair spectrum scheduling method. One of the major challenges in open spectrum usage is the spectrum sharing. It can be regarded to be similar to generic [[media access control]] MAC problems in existing systems

=== Cognitive radio (CR) versus intelligent antenna (IA) ===
[[Intelligent antenna]] (or [[smart antenna]]) is antenna technology using spatial beamforming and spatial coding to cancel interference; however, it requires intelligent multiple or cooperative antenna array. On the other hand, cognitive radio (CR) allows user terminals to sense whether a portion of the spectrum is being used or not, in order to share the spectrum among neighbor users. The following table compares the different points between two advanced approaches for the future wireless systems: Cognitive radio (CR) vs. Intelligent antenna (IA).

==Description==
In response to the operator's commands, the cognitive engine is capable of configuring the radio system parameters. These parameters include "[[waveform]], protocol, operating frequency, and networking".<ref name=wipro>{{cite web|title=Software-Defined Radio. White Paper. A Technology Overview.(2002, August). pp 1-10. |url=http://www.broadcastpapers.com/whitepapers/WiproSDRadio.pdf?CFID=1289733&CFTOKEN=d39ad02d46e2f73c-652340C5-F32E-4237-83D81F2959FF7406|publisher=[[Wipro Technologies]]}}</ref> It functions as an autonomous unit in the communication environment and frequently exchanges information about the environment with the networks it is able to access as well as with other CRs ([[Wipro Technologies]], 2002).<ref name = wipro/> A CR "monitors its own performance continuously, in addition to "reading the radio's outputs"; it then uses this information to "determine the [[Radio frequency|RF]] environment, channel conditions, link performance, etc.", and adjusts the "radio's settings to deliver the required quality of service subject to an appropriate combination of user requirements, operational limitations, and regulatory constraints". These processes have been described as "reading the radio's meters and turning the radio's knobs".<ref name="cognitiveradio.wireless.vt.edu"/>

==Practical application==
CR can sense its environment and without the intervention of the user can adapt to the users communication needs while conforming to [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules. Conceptually, the amount of spectrum is infinite, practically for propagation and other reasons it is finite because of the desirability of certain portions of the band. Even the spectrum which is assigned is far from being 100% utilized, hence efficient use of the spectrum is a growing concern. CR offers a solution to this problem. A CR can intelligently detect whether any portion of the spectrum is in use or not, and can temporarily latch into or out of it without interfering with the transmissions of other users thereby efficiently utilizing spectrum. According to Dr.Bruce Fette (2004), "Some of the radio's other cognitive abilities include determining its location, sensing spectrum use by neighboring devices, changing frequency, adjusting output power or even altering transmission parameters and characteristics. All of these capabilities, and others yet to be realized, will provide wireless spectrum users with the ability to adapt to real-time spectrum conditions, offering regulators, licenses and the general public flexible, efficient and comprehensive use of the spectrum".<ref>Dr.Bruce.Fette. (2004, October). Cognitive Radio Shows Great Promise.COTS Journal, [online].pp.1-5.

==The future of CR==
The phenomenal success of the unlicensed band in accommodating a range of wireless devices and services has led the FCC to consider opening further bands for unlicensed use. In contrast, the licensed bands are underutilized due to static frequency allocation. Realizing that CR technology has the potential to exploit the inefficiently utilized licensed bands without causing interference to incumbent users; the FCC released the Notice of Proposed Rule Making to allow unlicensed radios to operate in the TV broadcast bands. The [[IEEE 802.22]] working group formed in November/2004 is equipped with the task of defining the air interface standard for Wireless Regional Area Networks based on CR sensing for the operation of unlicensed devices in the spectrum allocated to TV service.<ref>Carlos Cordeiro, Kiran Challapali, and Dagnachew Birru.
