== Installing Windows Vista - UNSOLVED ==

I am trying to install windows Vista on my computer.  I currently have windows xp professional and i am installing the acadeimc upgrade edition of Vista homee premium on to a second partition on my hard drive.  I have tried to install multiple times except it crashes in the "completing windows installation" phase.  I have tried to use Microsoft's tech support for a week now, but they have been unable to get it to work.  Here is a list of the error messages that have been produced (there is not always a error message)
 IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL
 BAD_POOL_CALLER
 DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

System specs:
* Radeon x1950 pro
* 2gb ddr2 ram
* samsung sp2504c hard disk
* abit kn9s motherboard
* amd x2 4200+ processor

If amyone could help it would be greatly appreaciated [[User:Thepalm|Thepalm]] 00:21, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:::Several, slightly unrelated questions to hopefully stumble on the solution:  Does XP still boot?  Is the Vista install disc bootable, and does it boot okay?

:To continue the program, type "continue".  There's more [http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb_toc.html over here].

Is there anything special about the TFT on an iMac? Is it any differnt to the actual screens in standalone TFTs by other manufactureres? Many thanks, --Fadders 10:02, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

*The TFT screen on iMacs are pretty much the usual. To make a TFT screen much better than a regular screen, it would need to be a "Poly-Silicon" TFT screen, which it is not. Very few Poly-Silicon TFT screens are out there at all. They are also very rare in mobile cell phones. One notable exception was the Audiovox CDM-9900 cell phone with a striking Poly-Silicon TFT screen said by many to be the best screen ever used on a cell phone to date.

== BLUE ray reliability ==

I have heard that Blu-Ray discs are not so reliable with regards to scratches as they have such high density data packed that a single scratch could render a track useless, which is not so the case with DVD or Cd's.Is this somewhat true??[[User:59.92.240.161|59.92.240.161]]

:On one hand, a smaller scratch could indeed cause data loss (for a movie, the player might skip a bit on playback or show errors in the picture, or in extreme cases refuse to play at all.) On the other hand, disk manufacturers are aware of the potential problem and have worked hard to make the disks scratch resistant. See the section ''Hard-coating technology'' in the article on [[Blu-ray Disc]]s. DVDs and CDs aren't immune to scratches either. [[User:Weregerbil|Weregerbil]] 13:27, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

== Windows Vista Transformation ==

What Exactly is a transformation pack? Are transformation packs usually good? Can they be safely installed without reducing the comps speed?

How do i upload a picture?
:A vista transformation pack is a theme for windows XP to make it look like windows Vista. This is usually done with the skinning program [[WindowBlinds]]- which has a lot of memory overhead so I would never use it. The very best vista theme IMO is the original theme by KoL but Microsoft went crazy over it and sent all sorts of DMCA takedown notices so now it's awful tricky to find. The name is VistaXP v2 by KoL (v3 is only for windowblinds) if you want to find it yourself, or you can [[Special:Emailuser/Froth|email me]] and I'll send you the msstyles version (v2). This will run natively and take up just as much memory as the normal XP skin, but you have to patch one of your windows DLLs to get the theme applet to accept unsigned themes- I have the patcher too but if you want to look for it it's "UXTheme Multi-Patcher (Neowin Edition) 4.0" although you could just find a pre-patched uxtheme.dll without actually patching yours.

== Belkin Wireless router problem ==

I have a Belkin Wireless router hooked up to the Road Runner (my ISP) through one of their modems.  The router is a wireless G 2.4Ghz 802.11g model F5D7230-4.  For the past week, maybe once a day or maybe once ever other day, the router would completely blank out,  the modem light would blink green, and the wired connection to one computer would be orange (and that computer would say a network cable has been unplugged).  The Power light would turn off, wireless would stop blinking and internet would turn off.  Then, if I unplugged the router for 10 seconds or less, then plugged it back in, it would start working in a few seconds.  I wouldn't bother with the minor inconvenience of this except in the last 10 minutes it happened 5 times, and losing a connection randomly, frequently, is a little to much to simply shrug off.  The lights on the modem stay constant as they are when the lights on the router go out, so I have very little reason to believe it's the modem.  Does anyone know what may be causing it, and a good solution to fix it?  Thanks for your help. [[User:Chris Mason|Chris M.]] 19:25, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:Sounds like a connector problem with the power.  Does the connector feel secure?  Is the wall-wart making a good connection in the outlet?  —[[user:EncMstr|EncMstr]] 22:56, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

: Try pulling bending on the power leads and see if that causes the problem instantly. If it does you may have to tape up the lead to stop it moving. Some connectors degrade very quickly. I used to a this problem in a modem and it drove me nuts. Basically footsteps was enough vibration to make the power connector loose its connection and bounce back on.

I had the same problem with a Belkin router sometime last year.  I tried everything I could think of to get it to keep a connection, including updating the router's firmware.  Didn't even begin to make a difference.  I finally just broke down and purchased a different brand and haven't had a problem since.[[User:BrianWJ|BrianWJ]] 20:05, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

If the program is currently running, it will just save a copy of itself after you finish using your anti-spyware product.  Next time, do a reboot first, then use the task manager (CONTROL-ALT-DELETE) to kill everything but Explorer.  Now you can run your anti-spyware programs and have more hope of them working.  There likely are also registry entries that need to be removed, but a good anti-spyware program should do that for you, too. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 22:58, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:::Or just get into safe mode and do it there. --[[User: Antilived|antilived]]<sup>[[User_talk:Antilived|T]] | [[Special:Contributions/Antilived|C]] | [[User:Antilived/Gallery|G]]</sup> 02:40, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:My favorite method is booting into safe mode, then running Spyware Doctor, Ad-Aware, Spybot, and Webroot, then rebooting. A cocktail of antimalware is usually necessary for the really nasty or obscure stuff --[[User:Froth|'''⁪froth''']]<sup>[[User_talk:Froth|<small>t</small>]]</sup> 07:37, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

::Spybot S&D has an option to run at system boot so it can identify and kill anything before it has a chance to activate. Also running Spybot and the free version of Ad-aware  with all their latest updates installed rarely leaves anything behind. And if you are using a P2P program, check that it cant bypass firewalls as that can be causing your problem. [[User:Ikrizalllid|Ikrizalllid]] 12:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Thanks everyone for your suggestions.  I think I've killed it with a combination of Spyware Doctor, McAfee, and something called "SmitfraudFix". -[[User:GTBacchus|GTBacchus]]<sup>([[User talk:GTBacchus|talk]])</sup> 22:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

I keep getting boxes pop up advising me that I need to download software to protect my computer from viruses etc or requesting that I install a disc-cleaner because I have files of an adult nature. If I follow the instructions then my Norton Security advises me to block the action. Are these links bogus and if so how do I stop them from coming up?[[User:82.16.101.160|82.16.101.160]] 22:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)rob

:Yes, don't ever download something because a pop-up tells you to do so.  You now likely have [[malware]] on your computer.  Try using either [[AdAware]] or [[Spybot]] to remove the baddies.  You may also want to get a [[pop-up blocker]].  [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] 22:48, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
:: If this is while you're using [[Internet Explorer]], switch to [[Firefox]], which has pop-up blocking built in. If this is at other times, use [[Spybot S&D]] and scan your PC with your [[Antivirus]] software. --[[User:H2g2bob|h2g2bob]] 01:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
