{{nihongo|'''Wario'''|ワリオ}} is a [[fictional character]] in [[Nintendo]]'s [[Mario (series)|''Mario'']] series. The character was designed as another [[antagonist]] to [[Mario]] (besides [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]), and first appeared in the [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] [[Game Boy]] title ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' as the main antagonist and final [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. He was portrayed as an exaggerated version of Mario and his name is a variant of Mario's name (as shown by the W in his name, which is an upside down M that portrays him as an upside down Mario). Wario was first designed by [[Hiroji Kiyotake]], and is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices many other characters in the series.

Since his debut, Wario has appeared as [[protagonist]] and [[antihero]] of the [[Wario Land (series)|''Wario Land'']] and ''[[WarioWare]]'' series in addition to many appearances in games in the ''Mario'' series such as ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'' and ''[[Yoshi's Island DS]]''. He has also appeared in other media such as the ''[[Super Mario Adventures]]'' graphic novel.

==Concept and creation==
[[File:Wario emblem.svg|125px|thumb|left|This emblem appears on Wario's hat and represents him in many [[Mario (series)|''Mario'']] games.|alt=A white circle with a blue "W" inside it is seen over a yellow background.]]
A rival to Mario first appeared in the 1985 game ''[[Wrecking Crew (video game)|Wrecking Crew]]'' in the form of Spike, a construction foreman.<ref name="kombo1">{{cite web |url=http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=10570 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080603115614/http://www.kombo.com/article.php?artid=10570 |archivedate=2008-06-03 |title=The History of Wario: Part 1 |author=David Oxford|publisher=Kombo |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref> Although Spike bears a slight resemblance, Wario was not to receive his true debut until 1992. The first named appearance of the character occurred in ''[[Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins]]'' where he was designed by game artist [[Hiroji Kiyotake]], who was also responsible for designing [[Samus Aran]] of ''[[Metroid]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/100/1007864p4.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Game Boy |author=Travis Fahs|publisher=IGN |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref> The motive for Wario's design arose from the distaste of ''[[Super Mario Land]]'s'' design team towards designing a game based around someone else's character. The creation of Wario allowed them a character of their own to "symbolize their situation".<ref name="kombo1"/>

Wario is portrayed as an exaggerated version of Mario; he has huge, muscular arms, a large [[moustache]], and a bellicose cackle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/360/360686p1.html |title=E3 2002: Hands on Wario World |publisher=IGN |date=2002-05-23|accessdate = 2011-08-29}}</ref> The name ''Wario'' is a [[portmanteau]] of Mario's name with the Japanese adjective ''warui'' (悪い) meaning "bad"; hence, a "bad Mario" (further symbolized by the "W" on his hat, an upside down "M"). When asked by fans if this meant Wario is a full-on ''bad guy'', Kiyotake established that Wario was an anti-hero, stating that "Wario will ally himself with Mario when the consequences call for it, but being the famous plumbers more naive and thick-headed cousin, he usually only does things his way and only wants to accomplish his goals." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/924/924285_biography.html |title=IGN: Wario Biography |publisher=IGN |date=2010-03-29 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> Voice actor [[Charles Martinet]], who had voiced Mario since 1987, auditioned to provide the voice for Wario in 1993. Martinet was told to speak in a mean and gruff voice, and described voicing Wario as a looser task than voicing Mario, since Mario's voice and personality is free-flowing, coming from the ground and floating into the air, while one of Wario's cornerstones is self-pity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Martinet Celebrates 15 Years of Wario with Kombo |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090324092141/http://wii.kombo.com/article.php?artid=12729|archivedate=2009-03-24|url=http://wii.kombo.com/article.php?artid=12729 |publisher=Kombo |accessdate=2009-10-01 |date=2008-09-15}}</ref> Starting with ''[[Super Mario Land 3: Wario Land]]'', Wario experiences rejuvenating effects from garlic. The character is also often seen making use of bombs, as in ''Wario Land'' and ''[[Wario Blast]]''. The WarioWare series prominently uses bombs as a visual motif in every microgame to represent the time limit.

In video games in which Wario makes a cameo appearance, he is often portrayed as a villain. However, the development team for ''[[Wario Land: The Shake Dimension]]'' stated that he was not really a villain, and they did not consider this during development. They focused on his behavior, which alternates between good or evil.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wario Land Interview |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/914/914577p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-09-06 |date=2008-09-30}}</ref> [[Etsunobu Ebisu]], a producer of ''The Shake Dimension'', considers Wario to be a reckless character, who uses his strength to overwhelm others. Tadanori Tsukawaki, the design director of ''The Shake Dimension'', described Wario as manly, and said he was "so uncool that he ends up being extremely cool". Because of this, he wished for Wario to come off as macho rather than silly, and requested that the art designers emphasize his masculinity.<ref name="nuk">{{cite web |title=Meet the brains behind Wario Land |url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/meet_the_brains_behind_wario_land_9513.html |publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of UK]] |accessdate=2009-09-06 |date=2008-09-18}}</ref> Wario was chosen as the star of the [[Wario (series)|''WarioWare'' series]] because the developers felt it was the best character for the franchise, in particular for frequently acting stupid.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo R&D1 Interview with the WarioWare team |url=http://archive.videogamesdaily.com/features/ncl_nintendo_wwiv_apr06_p1.asp |publisher=[[Kikizo]] |accessdate=2009-09-06 |date=2006-04-07}}</ref>

In 2003, the ''Wario'' franchise introduced a new series of games, starting with ''[[WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames!]]'' for the Game Boy Advance.

The gameplay of the title involved playing a collection of said microgames in quick succession.

==Reception==
Since his appearance in ''Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3'', Wario has become a well-established mascot for Nintendo,<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Lucas M. |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/101/1012415p1.html |title=The DSi Virtual Console Wishlist - DS Feature at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> and also received a largely positive critical reception. The video gaming magazine ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' described Wario as a "pretty uncool dude" which they "cannot help but like", and also listed him as having one of the best mustaches in Nintendo games.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Nintendo Power]] 250th issue! |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future US]] |location=[[South San Francisco, California]] |pages=46, 47 |accessdate=2010-07-24}}</ref> ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' found the levity of Wario's games "liberating" compared to big Nintendo franchises such as ''Mario'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', and that regarding the character, "perhaps secretly we empathise more with the hopelessly materialistic Wario than goody brown-shoes Mario. Deep down, we'd all rather chase [[Pound sterling|pounds]] over princesses."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/281076/features/time-machine-wario/ |title=Time Machine: Wario |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=2010-12-31 |accessdate=2011-08-26}}</ref> [[IGN]] editor Travis Fahs commented that while Wario was not the most likeable character, he has incredible confidence that overshadows his flaws and makes him entertaining.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fahs |first=Travis |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/894/894013p1.html |title=Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3 Retro Review - Game Boy Review at IGN |publisher=IGN |date=2008-07-25 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> The website later ranked Wario 31st in a list of the "Top 100 Videogame Villains".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/videogame-villains/31.html |title=Wario is number 31 |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}</ref>  In the book ''A Parent's Guide to Nintendo Games: A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games'', author Craig Wessel described Wario as a "sinister twist" on Mario.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bc8TAQAAIAAJ |title=A Parent's Guide to Nintendo Games: A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games |publisher=[[Mars Publications]] |author=Craig Wessel, [[Stratos Group]] |date=2001 |accessdate=2010-06-12}}</ref> In the book ''Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: An Encyclopedia of Our Worst Nightmares, Volume 1'', author S.
