'''Yat''' is a [[dialect]] of [[English language|English]] spoken in the [[Greater New Orleans Area]]. The term refers to those people who speak with the Yat accent and dialect of New Orleanians throughout the city. The name comes from the common use amongst said people of the greeting, "Where y'at?" (Where you at?), which is a way of asking, "How are you?"  The Yat dialect has its influences from Louisiana French and [[Southern American English]], particularly [[Southern American English#Older SAE|Older Southern American English]].{{Citation needed|reason=This uncited statement is directly contradicted by the quote below from Liebling's book, which states that the accent was brought by the same stock of immigrants who brought it to Manhattan.|date=October 2011}} While the term ''Yat'' is usually reserved specifically for the strongest varieties of the New Orleans dialect, the term often refers specifically to speakers of Yat in some parts of the city and the inner suburbs of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. Though Yat is said to be the language of the [[Ninth Ward]], "Yat" is one of many sub-dialects of the New Orleans dialect that is spoken throughout the city.

==History==
The origins of the accent are described in [[A. J. Liebling]]'s book, ''[[The Earl of Louisiana]]'', in a passage that was used as a foreword to [[John Kennedy Toole]]'s well-known [[Posthumous work|posthumously published]] [[novel]] about [[New Orleans]], ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'':<ref>Toole, John Kennedy (1980). ''A Confederacy of Dunces''. Baton Rouge: LSU.</ref>

{{cquote|There is a New Orleans city accent . . . associated with [[downtown]] New Orleans, particularly with the [[Germany|German]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Third Ward of New Orleans|Third Ward]], that is hard to distinguish from the accent of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[Jersey City]], and [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]], [[Long Island]], where the [[Al Smith]] [[inflection]], extinct in [[Manhattan]], has taken refuge. The reason, as you might expect, is that the same stocks that brought the accent to Manhattan imposed it on New Orleans.<ref>Liebling, A. J. (1970). ''The Earl of Louisiana''. Baton Rouge: LSU.</ref>}}

The quote above is a little dated, because large parts of the Third Ward of New Orleans are no longer German and Irish, as with most of the city of New Orleans. 

Historically, the city of New Orleans was home to people of [[French people|French]] and [[Spanish people|Spanish]] heritage, as well as those of [[African American|African]] heritage, which led to the creation of the [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]] language.  This city came under U.S. rule in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], and over the course of the 19th century, the city transitioned from speaking French to becoming a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] English speaking society. Similarly, much of the south has historically spoken non-rhotic English. The city's geographic isolation has helped lead to the creation of a new local dialect.

A misconception in other parts of the US is that the local dialect of New Orleans is [[Cajun]]. The city's cultural and linguistic traditions are distinct from that of the predominantly rural [[Acadiana]], an area spanning across South Louisiana. While there has been an influx of Cajuns into the city since the oil boom of the later 20th century and while there are some similarities due to shared roots, Cajun culture has had relatively little influence upon Creole culture and thus Yat culture. The confusion of Cajun culture with the Creole culture is largely due to the confusion of these French cultures by the tourism and entertainment industries; sometimes deliberately as "Cajun" was discovered to be a potentially lucrative marketing term.

A ''Yat'' accent is considered an identity marker of a White person born and raised in the greater New Orleans area. Speakers with a ''New Orleans accent'' often find a sense of pride in having a local accent. This dialect is closely associated with the white population of the New Orleans metropolitan area. However, due to most of the African-American population living there prior to 1803 during the colonial French era, Black New Orleanians do share more lingual characteristics with the white population than most other places in the southern United States. This distinctive accent is dying out generation by generation in the city due to white flight of the city, but remains very strong in the suburbs.

==Local Variance==
The Yat dialect is the most pronounced version of the ''New Orleans Accent''. Natives often speak with varying degrees of the ''[[Brooklynese|Brooklyn]]-esque'' accent, ranging from a slight intonation to what is considered full Yat. As with all dialects, there is variance by local speakers due to geographic and social factors. This results in many different levels of Yat throughout the area, marking distinct differences between higher-income people and lower-income people. Yat tends to differ in strength and intonation from neighborhood to neighborhood. The type, strength, and lexicon of the accent vary from section to section of the New Orleans Metropolitan Area. Longtime residents can often tell what area the other residents are from by their accent.

Speakers of this dialect originated in the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|Ninth Ward]], as well as the [[Irish Channel, New Orleans|Irish Channel]] and [[Mid-City, New Orleans|Mid-City]]. Slighter intonations of the dialect can be heard in some parts of the city, such as Lakeview, the Marigny, the Garden District, and some parts of Gentilly, but mainly in the suburbs. The dialect is present to some degree in all seven parishes that make up the [[New Orleans metropolitan area]], from St. Tammany to Plaquemines. As with many [[sociolinguistic]] artifacts, the dialect is usually more distinct among older members of the population. The New Orleans suburban area of [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]] is known for the strongest Yat accent of the Greater New Orleans area, due to the massive population of White Ninth Warders relocating to Chalmette in [[St. Bernard Parish]], [[Louisiana]].

==Linguistic features==
===Pronunciation===
There are also numerous phonological differences between words pronounced in the dialect and their standard equivalents. This most often occurs in the form a stress-shift towards the front of a word (i.e. 'insurance', 'ambulance' as {{IPA|[ˈinʃuɻəns]}}, {{IPA|[ˈæmbjəˈlæns]}}), or in the form of a change in vowel quality. Some of the most distinct features are:
*the rounding and lowering in some cases of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} to {{IPA|[ɔʷ]}} (i.e.,  'God,' 'on,' 'talk', become {{IPA|[ɡɔʷd]}}, {{IPA|[ɔʷn]}}, {{IPA|[tɔʷk]}})
*the loss of [[rhoticization]] on syllables ending in {{IPA|/ɻ/}} (i.e. 'heart,' fire' become {{IPA|[hɔʷt]}}, {{IPA|[ˈfajə]}})
*the full rhoticization of a syllable-internal {{IPA|/ɔj/}} (i.e. 'toilet,' becomes {{IPA|[ˈtɝlɪt]}}). This feature is more typical in men than in women.
*the loss of [[frication]] in the [[interdental fricative]]s {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} (i.e. 'the,' 'there,' 'strength' become {{IPA|[də]}}, {{IPA|[ˈdæə]}}, {{IPA|[ʃtɻejnt]}})
*the substitution of {{IPA|/ɪn/}} or {{IPA|/ən/}} (spelled -in, -en) for {{IPA|/ɪŋ/}} (spelled -ing)
*the split of the historic short-a class into tense {{IPA|[eə]}} and lax {{IPA|[æ]}} versions
*the [[Phonological history of English diphthongs#Coil–curl merger|coil–curl merger]] of the phonemes {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ɝ/}}, creating the diphthong {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}}, before a consonant, in words such as boil, oil, and spoil, although this feature has mostly receded, except St. Bernard Parish

And then there are words which can be pronounced differently, yet according to no particular pattern: , 'sink' {{IPA|[ˈziŋk]}}, 'room' {{IPA|[ˈɻʊm]}}, 'mayonnaise' {{IPA|[ˈmejnæz]}}, 'museum' {{IPA|[mjuˈzæm]}}, 'ask' {{IPA|[ˈæks]}}, just to name a few examples.

[[New Orleans]] is pronounced {{IPA|[nəˈwɔʷlɪnz]}}, {{IPA|[nəˈwɔʷlijənz]}} or with the {{IPA|/ɻ/}} still intact. The 'Nawlins' {{IPA|[nɔlɪnz]}} of the tourist industry and the common {{IPA|[nuwɔɻˈliːnz]}} are not to be heard among natives. [[Louisiana]] is pronounced as the standard {{IPA|[luˈwiziænə]}} or a slightly reduced {{IPA|[ləˈwiziænə]}}, but never as {{IPA|[ˈluziænə]}}.

==New Orleans accent in popular conception==
[[Image:Riverbend6DecLeidenheimerTruckVicNatly.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The characters "Vic & Nat'ly" by local cartoonist [[Bunny Matthews]] are stereotypical Yats.]]
The distinct New Orleans dialect has been depicted in many ways throughout the city and the U.S.

The [[main character]] of the [[cartoon strip]] [[Krazy Kat]] spoke in a slightly exaggerated [[phonetic]]ally-rendered version of early-20th century Yat; friends of the New Orleans-born [[cartoonist]] [[George Herriman]] recalled that he spoke with many of the same distinctive [[pronunciation]]s. 

[[Benny Grunch and the Bunch]] recorded an [[album]] known as the ''12 Yats of Christmas'', which is one of the truest expressions of Yat [[dialect]] and [[culture]]. The songs explain much of the local [[Norm (sociology)|customs]] and [[traditions]] of New Orleans and the surrounding areas, but perhaps raise as many questions as they answer for outsiders, because the [http://www.bennygrunch.com/song_lyrics.html lyrics] are mostly ''in'' Yat. The local [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WWL-TV]] Channel 4 usually broadcasts [[video]]s of the songs during the [[Christmas]] holidays during their evening [[newscast]]s and via the station's [http://www.wwltv.com/ website].

Actual New Orleans accents were long seldom heard nationally (New Orleanians who attained national prominence in the media often made an effort to tone down or eliminate the most distinctive local pronunciations{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}). After the displacement of Greater New Orleans area residents due to Hurricane Katrina, the [[United States]] was introduced to some of the New Orleans yat accents due to the constant news coverage. [[Stephen Seagal]]'s show ''[[Steven Seagal: Lawman|Lawman]]'', also exposed some of the Yat accents and dialects to the nation as well.

[[Ronnie Virgets]], a New Orleans writer, commentator, and journalist, employs New Orleans dialects and accents in his written and spoken works, including the locally produced public radio program, ''Crescent City''.  [[WWNO]], the local public radio station, broadcasts the program and provides access to past ''Crescent City'' programs on its website.

A Midwest Cajun restaurant chain based in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]] carries the name [http://www.yatscajuncreole.com/ Yats].  Also, cell phone company [[Boost Mobile]] used the phrase "Where Y'At?" in early advertising campaigns.

[[Who Dat?]] is a chant used in support of the [[New Orleans Saints]] [[American football|football]] team. The entire chant is "Who dat? Who dat? Who dat say dey gonna beat dem Saints?" Saints fans are collectively called "Who Dat Nation."

The Yat dialect is seldom heard when New Orleans is depicted in movies and television shows.  Traditionally, characters portrayed from New Orleans are heard using a southern or Cajun accent.
