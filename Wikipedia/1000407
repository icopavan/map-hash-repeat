==History==

Stefani first came face to face with designing clothes when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young. Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great - grandmother would sew clothes. Stefani made most of the things she wore onstage during concerts herself. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she felt she lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to [[haute couture]] clothing.<ref>[http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/032204/page2.html "First Lady Of Rock"] ''Vogue'' Retrieved 24 September 2007</ref> Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001050435 "Billboard News"] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Retrieved October 13, 2007</ref> Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.<ref>[http://www.frillr.com/?q=node/2711 "Gwen Stefaniâ€™s L.A.M.B., clothing line loses head designer"] ''frillr'' Retrieved October 14, 2007</ref> L.A.M.B. started out as a collaboration with [[LeSportsac]] in 2003.<ref name=mtv>Moss,Corey [http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200301/31002882.html "Gwen Stefani's Fabric Kingdom Starts With Handbags, Wallets"] ''[[MTV]]'' Retrieved November 8, 2007</ref>  The name L.A.M.B. is an acronym which stands for ''Love.

The fashion line manufactures clothes, shoes, bags and a fragrance called "L". The brand started out as a line for women, but claims the track items are unisex.
