'''Dettmar Cramer''' (born 4 April 1925 in [[Dortmund]]) is a [[Germany|German]] former [[association football|football]] player and coach who led [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] to the [[European Cup 1974-75|1975]] and [[European Cup 1975-76|1976]] [[UEFA Champions League|European Cups]]. Cramer is commonly considered to be the father of modern football in [[Japan]] and is a member of the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]], 3rd Class.  He also briefly coached the [[United States men's national soccer team]].

==Career==
Known as the “Football Professor” because of his attention to detail and also as “[[Napoleon]]” because of his diminutive 1.61 meter stature, Cramer began his career at Viktoria Dortmund and [[Germania Wiesbaden]].  The beginning of his managerial career lead him to clubs such as [[SV Lippstadt 08|Teutonia Lippstadt]], VfL Geseke, [[SC Paderborn 07|FC Paderborn]], and TuS Eving-Lindenhorst.  At the turn of the year 1948-49, Cramer found himself in the service of the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) for the first time.  Until 1963 he served with the designation as Head Coach for Western Germany under the DFB in [[Duisburg]].

Little known, Cramer attempted to make the jump into a career in [[journalism]] at this point.  He became lead editor for sports for German television station [[ZDF]].  Feeling largely isolated from the football world, Cramer decided to call it quits after only six months on the job.  Afterward he was sent by the DFB to [[Japan]] to serve as a football instructor.  

In order to strengthen its national team ahead of the [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympic Games]] four years later, the [[Japan Football Association]] had the idea in 1960 of bringing in a foreign professional coach.  Cramer was ultimately selected for this role.  Through Cramer's coaching and leadership, and the efforts of his players, the [[Japanese national football team|Japanese national team]] achieved a surprise upset of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] at the Tokyo Olympics.  The significane of this historic result was not lost on Cramer who saw it as a confirmation that Japanese football was vastly improving. Cramer's efforts were not limited to the national team, as he also formulated and implemented policies for general development. The foundation of a first national league, the training of other coaches, and the strengthening of the national team would all contribute to Japan's success at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|Mexico City Olympics]] four years later, where Japan would take home the bronze medal. 

On January 1, 1964, Cramer returned to Germany to take up a position as an assistant to German national coach [[Helmut Schön]].  In this capacity he was a part of the coaching staff at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|World Cup in 1966]], where [[West Germany]] lost in the final on a controversial call by a Russian linesman.  His talents were highly regarded by [[FIFA]] (Federation Internationale de Football Association), which contracted him as a coach from 1967 to 1974 and sent him on a tour of the globe, but during this time, Cramer would also run the 1st FIFA Coaching Course in Japan in 1969, and sowed the seeds for a coach training structure in Japan.  Additionally, on August 1, 1974, Cramer was selected by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] to become the head coach of the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States men’s national football team]].  

During his time in national team service, Cramer received numerous coaching offers from German clubs in the [[Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], although he consistently turned them down.  Then, on January 16, 1975, he took over the reins as manager of German giants [[FC Bayern Munich]].  At the beginning, Cramer faced heavy criticism in [[Munich]], mostly because of his passive management style.  With rumors of a sacking swirling around Cramer, he was strongly backed by team captain [[Franz Beckenbauer]], who felt indebted to him because of his insistence that Beckenbauer be allowed to return to the [[German national football team|German national team]] after initially being banned for impregnating a girl out of wedlock.
  
Cramer would lead Bayern to victory in the 1975 and 1976 [[UEFA Champions League|European Champions Cup]] in addition to capturing the [[FIFA World Club Cup|World Club Cup]] in ’76.  However, the ’76 Bundesliga season saw Bayern unable to recapture their form, and after a season that saw them fail to defend their domestic title, Cramer was forced to resign his position.  Cramer was involved in a trade between Bayern and [[Eintracht Frankfurt]], which saw him take the top spot at Frankfurt, while Frankfurt coach [[Gyula Lorant]] made his way to Bayern.  Neither club was happy with the trade, as Bayern finished a club worst 12th in the table, while Frankfurt’s results were mediocre at best.  As a result, the club parted ways with him on June 30, 1978.

Not until the 1982-83 season did Cramer find himself employed in the Bundesliga again, this time with club [[Bayer Leverkusen]].  At Leverkusen he managed to lead the club to their first top 9 finish in the league during his second year in charge.  Failure to build on that accomplishment lead to his dismissal after his third season in charge.
  
Never to coach in the Bundesliga again, Cramer instead found coaching positions with various international clubs and associations around the world.  In 2002, Cramer officially announced his retirement from football.  In 2005, he was inducted into the Japan Football Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Cramer served in [[World War II]] as a [[Oberleutnant|Senior Lieutenant]] with a German [[Fallschirmjäger|paratrooper]] division.  He is currently married for the second time and lives with his family in [[Reit im Winkl]], [[Bavaria]]. 
 
For his international achievements, Cramer was awarded two honorary doctorates in addition to being presented with the [[Federal Cross of Merit|Bundesverdienstkreuz]] (Federal Cross of Merit) in Germany.  In 1971, [[Emperor Hirohito]] also personally presented him with membership in the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] for his service to Japan.  Furthermore, Cramer is an honorary chieftain in the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Sioux]] and [[Mohican]] tribes.
