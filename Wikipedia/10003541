<!-- Bernie Whitebear, consistently preferred the term "Indian" to "Native American", so presumably we should follow that in our article. -->
'''Bernie Whitebear''' (September 27, 1937 – July 16, 2000<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 78, 191.</ref>), birth name '''Bernard Reyes''',<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 78.</ref> was an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] activist, a co-founder of the [[Seattle Indian Health Board]] (SIHB), the [[United Indians of All Tribes Foundation]], and the [[Daybreak Star Cultural Center]].<ref>Reyes 2002, ''passim'', especially p. 186 ''et. seq.''</ref>

==Youth==
Whitebear's mother, born Mary Christian, was [[Sin Aikst]] (now known as Lakes tribe, one of the Confederated Tribes of the [[Colville Indian Reservation|Colville Reservation]]); his father, Julian Reyes, was [[Philippines|Filipino]], but had largely assimilated to an Indian way of life. Born in the Colville Indian Hospital in [[Nespelem, Washington]], he was named "Bernard" after his great uncle (brother of his maternal grandmother), Chief [[James Bernard (chief)|James Bernard]], a Sin Aikst leader in the early 20th century.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 38 ''et. seq.'', 78.</ref><ref>McRoberts 2003 says he was born at [[Inchelium, Washington]]; Reyes indicates that is where the family was living at the time, but Reyes 2006 p. 3–4 indicates the hospital birth. Also, McRoberts says he was "one of six children of an Indian mother and Filipino father"; presumably he is including the half-siblings his mother later had with Harry Wong.</ref> Around 1970, as he became an activist, he changed his name to honor his mother's father, Alex Christian, known as ''Pic Ah Kelowna,'' "White Grizzly Bear".<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 31 ''et. seq.'', 187.</ref>

His early childhood was a spent largely on the [[Colville Indian Reservation]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. His parents separated in 1939 and subsequently divorced;<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 90.</ref> his mother would later re-marry to Harry Wong, with whom she and Julian Reyes had, in 1935–1937, run a Chinese restaurant during the construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]].<ref>Reyes 2002, p. p. 74–75, 185, 194.</ref> While his older brother [[Lawney Reyes]] and sister [[Luana Reyes]] attended the [[Chemawa Indian School]] in 1940–1942, he was too young to do so, and lived with foster grandparents, the Halls.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 93, 103.</ref> 

The rest of his childhood and youth was spent living with his father, variously on the Colville Reservation and in [[Okanogan, Washington]],<ref>Reyes 2002, ''passim''.</ref> where he graduated from high school in 1955.<ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 186">Reyes 2002, p. 186.</ref> Being from a musically inclined family,<ref>Various mentions in Lawney Reyes's several memoirs, but see especially Reyes 2008, p. 94–102 about his father, sister, and brother performing in vaudeville.</ref> he took up the trumpet, eventually becoming the lead trumpet of the Okanogan High School band.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 52.</ref> He was popular in his otherwise all-white high school, although some of his classmates' parents didn't approve of them socializing with (or, especially, dating) an Indian.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 55–60.</ref>

After attending one year of school at the [[University of Washington]], he spent a bit over a year living with his mother in [[Tacoma, Washington]]. There he first met, and fished with, [[Bob Satiacum]]. [[Drift netting]] for salmon in Tacoma's [[Commencement Bay]] and the rivers that fed into it, they were repeatedly harassed by white sport fishermen and by the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. In September 1957 he enlisted in the [[United States Army]], where he served first in the [[101st Airborne Division]] as a [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] [[paratrooper]].<ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 186"/><ref>Reyes 2006, p. 61 ''et. seq.''; p. 71 for when he enlisted.</ref>

==Forging a contemporary Indian identity==
After leaving the army in 1959 and returning to the [[Seattle]]-[[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] area of Washington State, he took a job at [[Boeing]] and remained in the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]].<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 72–73.</ref> He soon changed his name to "Bernie Whitebear" and renewed his friendship with Satiacum and others who were fighting for native fishing rights on the [[Puyallup River]] and elsewhere in Western Washington, a fight that they would eventually win when the 1974 [[Boldt Decision]] made the Washington's tribes co-managers of the state's fisheries.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 186–187.</ref> 

The fishing rights struggle gave Whitebear a much stronger sense of conflicts between Indians and the white population than he had had growing up around Okanogan.<ref name=Reyes-2006-77 /> During this period, the struggle over the rights to fish for salmon occasionally reached the level of physical violence.<ref name=Reyes-2006-77>Reyes 2006, p. 77.</ref> Satiacum was prominent among those who continually upped the ante, deliberately netting fish in places where he knew it would provoke anger from sports fishermen.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 78.</ref> According to his brother and biographer Lawney Reyes, Whitebear, Satiacum, and a few other of their friends "spent a lot of time together partying and drinking" and styled themselves as a "[[fraternal organization]]" called the "Skins", with three Tacoma taverns as their "lodges". "When the Skins gathered," Reyes wrote, "others gave them a wide berth."<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 79.</ref> In Reyes's brother's view, through this period, Whitebear was "learning much about the problems of [[urban Indians]]" and developing an anger that he would soon put to constructive use.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 81 ''et. seq.''</ref><ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 187">Reyes 2002, p. 187.</ref> Through the early 1960s, he began searching for a way to change the dominant American culture's perception of Indians, and to support the recovery and retention of culture that was becoming lost as Indians were losing their specific tribal knowledge and traditions.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 83–85.</ref>

In the summer of 1961, along with his various family members, he was among those who successfully opposed a federal government proposal to "terminate" the Colville Reservation by paying [[United States dollar|US$]]60,000 to each tribal member to relinquish their rights as American Indians.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 87.</ref>

==Pow wows and performances==
As early as 1961, Whitebear organized a [[pow-wow]] at Seattle's Masonic Temple; in 1966 he moved to the city. Throughout this period, he retained his job at Boeing (and even played [[Sitting Bull]] in a Boeing employees' production of ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 89.</ref>), but also became involved with young Indians in learning the songs and dances of the [[Plains Indians|Plains]] and [[Plateau Indians]], as well as those of their own respective tribes. This involved tracking down Indians knowledgeable in these various traditions, and taught Whitebear himself the traditional songs and dances of many Native cultures.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 86–87.</ref>

In 1968, Whitebear had the opportunity to put together a Native American dance group to tour [[Southeastern Europe]] along with the Balkan-style Koleda Dance Ensemble. They later made a second trip, performing in France and Germany. According to Lawney Reyes, Whitebear's experiences in Europe helped him "realize his calling in life", to "make Indians more visible to white people" and to help "the various tribes… forge a united front."<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 89–91.</ref>

Returning home, Whitebear organized a series of pow wows larger than any that Seattle had ever seen, taking place at the [[Mercer Arena]] at [[Seattle Center]], and bringing together some of the leading singers, dancers, and drummers of Plains and Plateau traditions, as well as of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast Indians]].<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 91 ''et. seq.''</ref>

==Activist and leader==
During this same period, Whitebear became particularly interested in health issues among Seattle's Indians.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 93.</ref> At this time, Seattle's estimated 25,000 urban Indians had "no health services, no organization, no money and no meeting place except an old church on Boren Avenue".<ref>Cate Montana, [http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=2504 Tireless advocate Bernie Whitebear mourned], August 2, 2000, ''Indian Country Today''. Accessed online 12 March 2007. [http://web.archive.org/web/20070430180708/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=2504 Archived] 2007-04-30 on the [[Internet Archive]].</ref> Alaskan Native Bob Lupson had helped to organize a free clinic for Indian People at Seattle's [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health]] Hospital, (later the [[Pacific Medical Center]]); other key figures in the clinic were Lyle Griffith, an [[Oglala Sioux]] who was then a medical resident at the University of Washington, and Lyle's wife Donna Griffith, and later New Yorkers Peter and Hinda Schnurman, Jill Marsden from England, and pharmacist Eveline Takahashi.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 93–94.</ref>

At this time, Bernie Whitebear left Boeing to become part of this clinic, which in 1969 established itself as a separate non-profit, the Seattle Indian Health Board (SIHB). In 1970, Whitebear became the group's first executive director.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 94–96.</ref> Lawney Reyes characterizes the SIHB as "the first major achievement for the Indian community in Seattle," and remarks that his brother became executive director not because he knew anything in particular about healthcare but "because he was Indian and well spoken." Jill Marsden became increasingly the real administrator of the group, and after about a year Whitebear resigned, in order to focus more on obtaining some sort of land base for Seattle's Indians. A national search for a new executive director ended up hiring Whitebear's sister Luana, who until this time had been a successful businesswoman in [[San Francisco]].<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 96–97.</ref> Over the next decade, she built SIHB into a 200-employee institution recognized as a national model, and launched herself on a career path that ultimately led to the deputy directorship of the federal [[Indian Health Service]].<ref name=Reyes-2002-185-186>Reyes 2002, p. 185–186.</ref><ref>Reyes 2006, p. 97.</ref>

Shortly after this, he became heavily involved in the movement to make sure that Indians would gain a share of the land in Seattle that the federal government freeing up as they reduced the size of the [[Fort Lawton]] army post. The group was influenced by the [[Indians Of All Tribes]] (IAT) who were then [[occupation of Alcatraz|occupying Alcatraz Island]] in San Francisco Bay. Initially, they called themselves "Kinatechitapi", [[Blackfoot language|Blackfoot]] for "All Indians". Their first efforts to open discussions with the City of Seattle in advance of the turnover of the land failed. The City said it would not open discussions until it had the land, and referred them to the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA).<ref name=Whitebear-1994-4>Whitebear 1994, p. 4.</ref> As Whitebear later wrote, "This action displayed their ignorance of both the BIA's restricted service policy, which excluded urban Indians, and also the disregard and disfavor urban Indians held for the BIA."<ref name=Whitebear-1994-4 /> 

The Kinatechitapi split between a faction that called for [[direct action]] and one that preferred to wait until the land was in city hands and then attempt negotiation.<ref name=Whitebear-1994-4-5>Whitebear 1994, p. 4–5.</ref> Prominent among those who preferred to wait was Pearl Warren, founder of the American Indian Women's Service League, who was concerned that a militant attitude would undercut the existing city-funded services.<ref>Reyes 2006 p. 103.</ref> It was peaceably agreed that those who wished to take more extreme action would not use the name "Kinatechitapi",<ref name=Whitebear-1994-4-5/> but the resulting tensions led to Warren losing the next election for the Service League presidency to Joyce Reyes.<ref>Reyes 2006 p. 103–104.</ref> 

The more militant faction soon adopted the name "American Indian Fort Lawton Occupation Forces".<ref name=Whitebear-1994-4-5 /> Some of the Indians of All Tribes came in from Alcatraz, including [[Richard Oaks]], leader of that action; other activists came from Canada. A plan was formed to invade the base. Another arrival was [[Grace Thorpe]], daughter of athlete [[Jim Thorpe]]. Meanwhile, ongoing protests around nearby [[Fort Lewis]], including by American Indian soldiers, were tying native rights to opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]. At the behest of the Fort Lewis coalition, [[Jane Fonda]] was in town when the invasion took place.<ref name=Whitebear-1994-5>Whitebear 1994, p. 5.</ref> According to Whitebear, her presence "captured the imagination of the world press. American Indians were attacking active military forts along with one of the nation's leading opponents of United States involvement in the Vietnam War." Her presence transformed "an effort to secure a land base for urban Indians" into "a bizarre, ready-for-prime-time, movie scenario, complete with soldiers, modern-day Indians, and anti-war activists. Without really appreciating it at the time, the Indian movement had achieved through Jane Fonda's presence, a long-sought credibility which would not have been possible otherwise."<ref>Whitebear 1994, p. 5. Typos in the original have been corrected; it said "modem day-Indians"; this has been corrected to "modern-day Indians"; also, Fonda's name was typoed in one place as "Fcinda".</ref>

On March 8, 1970, Whitebear was among the leaders—arguably ''the'' leader—of about 100 "Native Americans and sympathizers" who confronted military police in riot gear at the fort. The MPs ejected them from the fort, but they were able to establish an encampment outside the fort. Organizing as the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation (UIATF), they used tactics ranging from politicking to occupation of land to celebrity appearances. Some of the key politicking came at the federal level: UIATF, like the City, filed to directly acquire land that the federal government was releasing, and the federal government ultimately insisted that the two come up with a joint plan. Negotiations, confrontation and even a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] intervention combined in November 1971 to give them a 99-year lease on 20 acres (81,000 m²) in what would become Seattle's [[Discovery Park (Seattle)|Discovery Park]], with options for renewal without renegotiation.<ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 187"/><ref name=Whitebear-1994-5 /><ref name="McRoberts 2003">McRoberts 2003</ref><ref>Reyes 2006, p. 97 ''et. seq.'', 113.</ref> In addition, the City gave $600,000 to the American Indian Women' Service League for a social services center.<ref name=Whitebear-1994-5 />

[[File:Daybreak Star Cultural Center 1.jpg|thumb|[[Daybreak Star Cultural Center]]]]
Whitebear was soon elected CEO of the UIATF.<ref name=Reyes-2002-185-186 /> At UIATF, he successfully oversaw  fundraising (including a million dollar grant from the state) and construction for what would become the [[Daybreak Star Cultural Center]]. His brother Lawney Reyes — a sculptor, designer, curator, and later memoirist<ref>Reyes 2002, ''passim'', especially p. 181 ''et. seq.''</ref> (as well as his biographer: ''Bernie Whitebear: An Urban Indian's Quest for Justice'', 2006) — joined with architects Arai Jackson to design the facility, which opened in 1977.<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 187–188.</ref><ref>Reyes 2006, p. 108 ''et. seq.'' provides several anecdotes about the fundraising for Daybreak Star.</ref>

Along with [[Bob Santos]], [[Roberto Maestas]], and [[Larry Gossett]], he became one of Seattle's so-called "[[Gang of Four (Seattle)|Gang of Four]]" or "Four Amigos" who founded Seattle's [[Minority Executive Directors's Coalition]].<ref>[http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/maestas.htm Roberto Maestas], Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project, University of Washington.

In addition, UIATF acquired other land in Seattle outside of Daybreak Star, including a quarter-block [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown]] at Second and Cherry.<ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 189">Reyes 2002, p. 189.</ref>

In the same era when Daybreak Star was being constructed, Whitebear served on the [[Seattle Arts Commission]].<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 113.</ref> In 1995, he was appointed to the board of the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], and was involved in the planning for the museum<ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 189"/> that opened September 21, 2004 on the National Mall in [[Washington, D.C.]].<ref>"The National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C." in [http://www.nmai.si.edu/subpage.cfm?subpage=collaboration&second=internships Internship Program], National Museum of the American Indian.

A People's Lodge at Daybreak Star is intended to include a Hall of Ancestors, a Potlatch House, a theater, and a museum;<ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 190">Reyes 2002, p. 190.</ref> the Pacific Northwest Indian Canoe Center is intended as part of the ongoing development at [[South Lake Union, Seattle, Washington|South Lake Union]], just north of downtown.<ref name="Reyes 2002, p. 190"/> Whitebear's death impacted both of these projects. {{As of|2007}}, construction of the People's Lodge has been indefinitely postponed.<ref>Aimee Curl, [http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-09-12/news/fort-lawton-freeze-tag.php Fort Lawton Freeze Tag], ''Seattle Weekly'', September 12, 2007.

Whitebear died of [[colon cancer]], July 16, 2000.<ref name="McRoberts 2003"/>

==Character and legacy==
Whitebear has been the subject of many tributes. One of the most unusual came from Washington governor [[Gary Locke]], who in November 1997 declared him to be the state's First Citizen of the Decade, later remarking after Whitebear's death that it should have been "of the Century".<ref>Reyes 2002, p. 191, 192.</ref> [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]] called him the most important Indian of the last century.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 136.</ref>

Besides his prominence as an activist and administrator, Whitebear continued intermittently to perform on stage. He and his Gang of Four colleagues sang and danced annually at the Community Show-Offs, where they "usually stole the show".<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 122.</ref>

Whitebear never married, nor had children,<ref name=Reyes-2006-118>Reyes 2006, ''passim.'', esp. p. 118.</ref> although Marilyn Sieber of the [[Nit Nat]] tribe was his "constant companion" for more than a decade in the 1970s and '80s, and the two were at one point engaged.<ref name=2006-117-118>Reyes 2006, p. 117–118.</ref> However, in effect, he was like a parent to "every Indian kid in Seattle",<ref name=Reyes-2006-118 /> He never acquired a personal fortune: he gave away most money that came his way to those he considered needier, even borrowing money from his siblings to do so.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 117. His brother Lawney Reyes narrates (Reyes 2006, p. 119) that Bernie was a soft touch for his nieces and nephews, often giving or lending them the very money he had borrowed from their parents.</ref> His only monetary self-indulgence was a collection of old cars that he tinkered with in his spare time. Most of them sat in his back yard; others ended up at Daybreak Star or in friends' yards.<ref>Reyes 2006, ''passim.'', p. 142.</ref>

Whitebear's death was front-page news in the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' and ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''. In fact, the ''Times'' ran front page stories on two successive days.<ref>Reyes 2006, p. 147.</ref>

In memory of Whitebear, there is now a Bernie Whitebear Memorial Ethnobotanical Garden next to the Daybreak Star Cultural Center.<ref>[http://www.edcc.edu/afterwords/?p=22 Bernie Whitebear Ethnobotanical Memorial Garden], AfterWords, Edmonds Community College, October 11, 2005.
