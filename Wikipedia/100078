'''Philip V''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Φίλιππος Ε΄'') (238 BC – 179 BC) was King of [[Macedon]] from 221 BC to 179 BC. Philip's reign was principally marked by an unsuccessful struggle with the emerging power of [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Philip was attractive and charismatic as a young man. A dashing and courageous warrior, he was inevitably compared to [[Alexander the Great]] and was nicknamed '''the darling of all Greece''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ἐρώμενος ἐγένετο τῶν Ἑλλήνων).<ref>[[Polybius]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+7.12&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234 7.12], on Perseus</ref><ref>Polybius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0233%3Abook%3D7%3Achapter%3D11 7.11.8] (Greek text)), on Perseus</ref><ref>Shipley, p. 56.</ref>

==Early life==
The son of [[Demetrius II of Macedon|Demetrius II]] and Chryseis, Philip was nine years old at his father's death in 229&nbsp;BC. He had an elder paternal half sister called [[Apama III|Apame]].<ref>http://www.livius.org/de-dh/demetrius/demetrius_ii.html</ref> His cousin, [[Antigonus III Doson|Antigonus Doson]], administered the kingdom as regent until his death in 221&nbsp;BC when Philip was seventeen years old.

On his ascent to the throne, Philip quickly showed that while he was young, this did not mean that Macedon was weak. In the first year of his rule, he pushed back the [[Dardani]] and other tribes in the north of the country.

==The Social War==
{{main|Social War (220–217 BC)}}
In the Social War ([[220 BC]]-[[217 BC]]), the Hellenic League of Greek states was assembled at Philip V’s instigation in [[Corinth]]. He then led the Hellenic League in battles against [[Aetolia]], [[Sparta]] and [[Elis]]. At the same time he was able to stamp on his own authority amongst his own ministers. His leadership during the Social War made him well-known and respected both within his own kingdom and abroad.

==First Macedonian War==
{{main|First Macedonian War}}

After the Peace of Naupactus in 217 BC, Philip V tried to replace [[Roman Republic|Roman]] influence along the eastern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], forming alliances or lending patronage to certain island and coastal provinces such as [[Lato]] on Crete. He first tried to invade [[Illyria]] from the sea, but with limited success. His first expedition in 216 BC had to be aborted, while he suffered the loss of his whole fleet in a second expedition in 214 BC.  A later expedition by land met with greater success when he captured [[Lissus]] in 212 BC.

In 215 BC he entered into a treaty with [[Hannibal]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general then in the middle of an invasion of Roman Italy. Their treaty defined spheres of operation and interest, but achieve little of substance or value for either side. Philip became heavily involved in assisting and protecting his allies from attacks from the [[Sparta]]ns, the Romans and their allies.

Rome's alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] in 211 BC effectively neutralised Philip's advantage on land. The intervention of [[Attalus I of Pergamum]] on the Roman side further exposed Philip's position in Macedonia.

Philip was able to take advantage of the withdrawal of Attalus from the Greek mainland in 207 BC, along with Roman inactivity and the increasing role of [[Philopoemen]], the [[strategos]] of the [[Achaean League]]. After sacking Thermum, the religious and political centre of [[Aetolia]], Philip was able to force the Aetolians to accept his terms in 206 BC. The following year he was able to conclude the [[Peace of Phoenice]] with Rome and its allies.

==Expansion in the Aegean==
{{main|Cretan War}}
Following an agreement with the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] to capture Egyptian held territory from the boy king [[Ptolemy V Epiphanes|Ptolemy V]], Philip was able to gain control of Egyptian territory in the [[Aegean Sea]] and in [[Anatolia]].
This expansion of Macedonian influence created alarm in a number of neighbouring states, including [[Pergamum]] and [[Rhodes]]. Their navies clashed with Philip’s off [[Chios]] and [[Lade]] (near [[Miletus]]) in 201 BC.  At around the same time, the Romans were finally the victorious over Carthage.

==Second Macedonian War==
{{main|Second Macedonian War}}
[[Image:Macedonia and the Aegean World c.200.png|thumb|right|Kingdom of Macedon on the eve of the Second Macedonian War, circa 200 BC.]]
In 200 BC, with Carthage no longer a threat, the Romans declared war on Macedon arguing that they were intervening to protect the freedom of the Greeks. After campaigns in [[Macedon]]ia in 199 BC and [[Thessaly]] in 198 BC, Philip and his Macedonian forces were decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]] in 197 BC. The war also proved the superiority of the [[Roman legion]] over the Greek [[phalanx formation]].

==Alliance with Rome==
{{main|Roman–Syrian War}}
The resulting peace treaty between Philip V and the Romans confined Philip to Macedonia and required him to pay 1000 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] [[indemnity]], surrender most of its fleet and provide a number of hostages, including his younger son Demetrius.
After this, Philip cooperated with the Romans and sent help to them in their fight against the Spartans under King [[Nabis]] in 195 BC.  Philip also supported the Romans against Antiochus III (192 BC-189 BC).

In return for his help when Roman forces under [[Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]] and his brother [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus]] moved through Macedon and [[Thrace]] in 190 BC, the Romans forgave the remaining indemnity that he had to pay and his son Demetrius was freed.  Philip then focused on consolidating power within Macedon. He reorganised the country's internal affairs and finances, mines were reopened and a new currency was issued.

==Final years==
However, Rome continued to be suspicious of Philip's intentions.  Accusations by Macedon's neighboring states, particularly [[Pergamum]], led to constant interference from Rome.  Feeling the threat growing that Rome would invade Macedon and remove him as king, he tried to extend his influence in the [[Balkans]] by force and diplomacy. However, his efforts were undermined by the pro-Roman policy of his younger son Demetrius, who was encouraged by Rome to consider the possibility of succession ahead of his older brother, [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]].  This eventually led to a quarrel between Perseus and Demetrius which forced Philip to decide reluctantly to execute Demetrius for treason in 180 BC. This decision had a severe impact on Philip's health and he died a year later at [[Amphipolis]].

He was succeeded by his eldest son [[Perseus of Macedon|Perseus]], who ruled as the last king of [[Macedon]].
