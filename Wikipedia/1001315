'''HMS Venerable (1899)''' was a [[Formidable class battleship|London class]] [[predreadnought]] [[battleship]], a sub-class of the [[Formidable class battleship]]s, and the third ship of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] to bear the name.

==Technical Description==

HMS ''Venerable'' was laid down at [[Chatham Dockyard]] on 2 January 1899, launched on 2 November 1899, and completed in November 1902<ref>Burt, p. 178</ref>

Like the first three ''Formidable''-class ships, ''Venerable'' and her four ''London''-class sisters were similar in appearance to and had the same armament as the [[Majestic class battleship|''Majestic'']] and [[Canopus class battleship|''Canopus'']] classes that preceded them. The ''Formidable''s and ''London''s are often described as improved ''Majestic''s, but in design they really were enlarged ''Canopus''es; while the ''Canopus'' class took advantage of the greater strength of the [[Krupp armor]] employed in their construction to allow the ships to remain the same size as the ''Majestic''s with increased tonnage devoted higher speed and less to armor without sacrificing protection, in the ''Formidable''s' and ''London''s' Krupp armor was used to improve protection without reducing the size of the ships.<ref name="Conway p. 36">''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860-1905'', p. 36</ref> The ''Formidable''s and ''London''s thus were larger than the two preceding classes, and enjoyed both greater protection than the ''Majestic''s and the higher speed of the ''Canopus'' class. The ''Formidable''s' and ''London''s' armor scheme was similar to that of the ''Canopus''es, although, unlike in the ''Canopus''es, the armor belt ran all the way to the stern; it was 215 feet (65.5 meters) long and 15 feet (4.8 meters) deep and 9&nbsp;inches (229&nbsp;mm) thick, tapering at the stem to 3&nbsp;inches (76.2&nbsp;mm) thick and 12 feet (3.7 meters) deep and at the stern to 1.5&nbsp;inches (38.1&nbsp;mm) thick and 8 feet (2.4 meters) deep.  The main battery turrets had Krupp armor, 10&nbsp;inches (254&nbsp;mm) on their sides and 8&nbsp;inches (203&nbsp;mm) on their backs.<ref name="Conway p. 36"/>

The ''Formidable''s and ''London''s improved on the main and secondary armament of previous classes, being upgunned from 35-caliber to 40-caliber 12-inch (305-mm) guns and from 40-caliber to 45-caliber 6-inch (152-mm) guns. The 12-inch guns could be loaded at any bearing and elevation, and beneath the turrets the ships had a split hoist with a working chamber beneath the guns that reduced the chance of a cordite fire spreading from the turret to the shell and powder handling rooms and to the magazines.<ref name="Conway p. 36"/>

The ''Formidable''s and ''London''s had an improved hull form that made them handier at high speeds than the ''Majestic''s. They also had inward-turning screws, which allowed reduced fuel consumption and slightly higher speeds than in previous classes but at the expense of less manoeuvrability at low speeds.<ref name="Conway p. 36"/>

A change in design from that of the first three ''Formidable''s occurred in ''Venerable'' and the other four ''London''s, which is why the ''London''s often are considered a separate class.<ref>For example, ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860-1905'', p. 37, and Burt, pp. 175-194, refer to the ''London''s as a separate class while Gibbons, p. 151, lists them all as part of the ''Formidable'' class. Burt refers to the ''London''s as the ''Bulwark'' class.</ref> The main difference in the ''Venerable'' and the other four ''London''s from the first three ships was thinner deck armor and some other detail changes to the armor scheme.<ref>''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860-1905'', p. 37</ref>

Like all [[predreadnought]]s, ''Venerable'' was outclassed by the [[dreadnought]] battleships that began to appear in 1906. Like other predreadoughts, however, ''Venerable'' took on some first-line duties during the early part of [[World War I]].

==Operational history==
===Pre-World War I===
After many delays due to difficulties with her machinery contractors, HMS ''Venerable'' commissioned on 12 November 1902 for service as Second [[Flagship]], [[Rear Admiral]], [[Mediterranean Fleet (Royal Navy)|Mediterranean Fleet]]. During her [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] service, she ran aground outside [[Algiers]] harbor, suffering slight [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] damage, and underwent a refit at [[Malta]] in 1906-1907.<ref name="Burt, p. 194">Burt, p. 194</ref> On 12 August 1907 she was relieved as flagship by battleship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1902)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']], and her Mediterranean service ended on 6 January 1908, when she paid off at [[Chatham Dockyard]].<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>

''Venerable'' recommissioned on 7 January 1908 for [[Channel Fleet]] service. She paid off at Chatham for an extensive refit in February 1909.<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>

The refit complete, ''Venerable'' recommissioned on 19 October 1909 for  service in the [[British Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. On 13 May 1912 she transferred to the Second [[Home Fleet]] at the [[Nore]]<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/> and went into the commissioned reserve with a nucleus crew as part of the [[British 5th Battle Squadron|5th Battle Squadron]].<ref>''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921'', p. 8</ref>

===World War I===
When [[World War I]] broke out in August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was assigned to the in the [[Channel Fleet]], based at [[Portland, England|Portland]]. Returning to full commission, ''Venerable'' patrolled the [[English Channel]], and on 25 August 1914 covered the movement of the [[Portsmouth Marine Battalion]] to [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]],<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>

In October 1914, ''Venerable'' was attached to the [[Dover Patrol]] for bombardment duties in support of Allied troops fighting on the front, and bombarded German positions along the Belgian coast between [[Westende]] and [[Lombardsijde]] from 27 October 1914 to 30 October 1914. She also served as flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Dover Patrol, Rear Admiral Sir [[Horace Hood]], from 27 October 1914 to 29 October 1914. On 3 November 1914, she was detached to support the [[East Coast Patrol]] during the [[Gorleston Raid]], then returned to the 5th Battle Squadron.<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>

The 5th Battle Squadron transferred from Portland to [[Sheerness]] on 14 November 1914 to guard against a possible German invasion of the United Kingdom. The squadron returned to Portland on 30 December 1914.<ref>Burt, p. 170</ref> ''Venerable'' again bombarded German positions near Westende on 11 March 1915 and 10 May 1915.<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>

====Dardanelles campaign====
On 12 May 1915, ''Venerable'' was ordered to the [[Dardanelles]] to replace battleship [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']] in the [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Dardanelles Campaign]]. From 14 August 1915 to 21 August 1915, she supported Allied attacks on [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] positions at [[Suvla Bay]].<ref>Burt, p. 194; ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906-1921'', p. 8</ref>

====Adriatic operations====
In October 1915, ''Venerable'' arrived at [[Gibraltar]] for a refit. Emerging from the refit in December 1915, she transferred to the [[Adriatic Sea]] to reinforce the [[Italian Navy]] against the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]], serving there until December 1916.<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>

====Subsidiary duties====
''Venerable'' then returned to the United Kingdom, arriving at [[Portsmouth Dockyard]] on 19 December 1916, where she was laid up. In February and March 1918 she was refitted there as a [[depot ship]], and she moved to Portland on 27 March 1918 to serve as a depot ship for [[minelayer|minelaying]] [[naval trawler|trawler]]s. She was attached to the Northern Patrol through August 1918, then to the Southern Patrol from September to December 1918.<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>

==Disposal==
''Venerable'' paid off into care and maintenance at Portland at the end of December 1918. She was placed on the disposal list there in May 1919 and on the sale list on 4 February 1920. She was sold to [[Stanlee Shipbreaking Company]] for scrapping on 4 June 1920, resold to [[Slough Trading Company]] in 1922, then resold again to a German firm in the middle of 1922. She was towed to Germany for scrapping.<ref name="Burt, p. 194"/>
