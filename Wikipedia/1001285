'''Greg "Diesel" Williams''' (born 30 September 1963) is a former champion Australian rules footballer, who played with [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], [[Sydney Swans]] and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian/Australian Football League]] during the 1980s and 1990s. A brilliant midfielder, he is a dual [[Brownlow Medal]] winner, and at his peak was the highest paid player in the history of the sport. He was also a very controversial player throughout his career, and was involved in a variety of scandals throughout the 1990s.

== Playing style ==
Williams made his name as one of the best [[Centre line|centres]] in the history of the game. He was particularly skilful at [[Handball (Australian rules football)|handpassing]], and was the most prolific user of the skill during his era.<ref name="encyc" /> The hallmark of Williams' play was his ability to win ground contests, and almost immediately free the ball to nearby team-mates via quick, accurate handpassing.<ref name="blueseum" /> To that end, Williams' other strengths included his vision and awareness of the team-mates around him; he is said to have been heavily involved in midfield tactics at [[ball-up]]s.<ref name="encyc" /> His kicking and ball winning skills were also strong.<ref name="blueseum" />

Williams strengths outweighed several negative physical characteristics which could have hindered his career as a footballer. Most notably, he was a very slow runner; he had been [[knock-kneed]] as a child, and his pace was not helped by five knee surgeries throughout his career. He was also short and stocky (and, indeed, overweight early in his career).<ref name="encyc" /> 

Williams became known by the nickname "Diesel", because his playing style was characterised as "slow, but reliable", much like a [[diesel engine]]. The name was given to him after his first VFL match by Geelong captain [[Michael Turner (Australian rules footballer)|Michael Turner]], and remains widely used.<ref name="blueseum" />

==Playing career==
=== Before the VFL ===
The third of eight children, Williams spent his early life in Melbourne, before moving to [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] at the age of 10. There, he played football for the [[Golden Square Football Club]] in the [[Bendigo Football League]], earning strong acclaim at junior levels, representing Victoria in the [[Teal Cup]] in 1980.<ref name="blueseum">{{cite web|url=http://www.blueseum.org/tiki-index.php?page=Greg+Williams|title=Greg Williams|publisher=Blueseum|accessdate=30 Aug 2011|date=28 Jun 2010}}</ref>

Prior to the 1982 VFL season, Williams trained in the pre-season with the [[Carlton Football Club]] (to which the Bendigo Football League was [[Zoning (Australian rules football)|zoned]]), but the Blues ultimately rejected him, deterred by his lack of speed and fitness. He returned to Golden Square for the season, winning the [[Bendigo Football League#Awards|Michelsen Medal]] as league [[best and fairest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bendigofnl.com.au/files/History/20110128%20Senior%20Football%20Records.pdf|title=Senior Football Records|publisher=Bendigo Football Netball League|accessdate=30 Aug 2011}}</ref> Carlton invited him to try out again in the 1983 pre-season, but again he was rejected. He returned to Golden Square, and once again he won the Michelsen Medal.<ref name="blueseum" />

===Geelong===
As Carlton had passed on Williams, other VFL clubs were able to recruit him, and prior to the 1984 season he was recruited to the [[Geelong Football Club]], then under coach [[Tommy Hafey]]. He made his debut in Round 1 and amassed 38 disposals, which remains a record for a player on debut in the recorded history of the league,{{Ref|1|Note 1}} and scored three Brownlow votes. He played twelve matches in his first season, missing much of the year with a knee injury. In his second season, he played every match, won the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy|VFL Players Association MVP Award]] and the [[Carji Greeves Medal]].<ref name="blueseum" /> He set new records for handpassing, with 399 handpasses for the season – a record which would stand until [[2006 AFL season|2006]] – and with 28 handpasses in the Round 22 match against [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] – a record which would be tied several times, but not broken until 2008.<ref name="records">{{cite web|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=30 Aug 2011|title=Player Season and Game Records|url=http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/playershi.html}}</ref>

===Sydney Swans===
At the end of 1985, when Hafey took the job as coach of the [[Sydney Swans]] after being sacked by Geelong, Williams was promptly offered a sizeable contract to follow Hafey to Sydney. Williams reported to have been offered roughly double the money he was on at Geelong. Williams accepted, and the deal was done with a transfer fee of $120,000 between the clubs, which was much less than the $200,000 that Geelong had sought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryfootyscores.com/media-articles/155-the-archive-with-richard-jones/2565-how-sqaure-boy-diesel-became-a-swan.html|title=How Square boy Diesel became a Swan|publisher=Country Footy Scores|accessdate=30 Aug 2011|first=Richard|last=Jones}}</ref>

Williams continued his strong form into his career with Sydney. In 1986, his first season there, Williams won the [[Brownlow Medal]] in a tie with {{AFL Haw}}'s [[Robert DiPierdomenico]], and made the All-Australian team for the first time; he would back this up with his second All-Australian selection in 1987, and he placed third for the Brownlow in 1989.<ref name="blueseum" /> In Round 19, 1989, Williams amassed 53 disposals, which remains the highest ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match; it included another haul of 28 handpasses, and his career best tally of six goals.<ref name="records" />

===Transfer to Carlton===
During 1991, Williams decided that he wanted to return to [[Melbourne]] the following season, and the [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and Carlton Football Clubs emerged as the two potential candidates. Since the introduction of the [[AFL Draft]] in 1986, Williams' move would need to take place as a trade, rather than with a transfer fee as had been the case under his first move; ultimately, St Kilda was not willing to agree to Sydney's requested trade, which would have included future dual-Brownlow Medallist [[Robert Harvey (footballer)|Robert Harvey]], and as a result Williams was traded to Carlton. In the end, a three-way trade involving Fitzroy was negotiated, with [[Simon Minton-Connell]] traded from Carlton to Sydney, [[Darren Kappler]] traded from [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] to Sydney, [[Peter Sartori]] and [[Ashley Matthews]] traded from Carlton to Fitzroy, and Williams traded from Sydney to Carlton.<ref name="blueseum" /> Williams was estimated to be on a contract worth more than $300,000 per year, which was then the highest contract in the history of the sport.<ref name="encyc" />

===Carlton===
After a solid 1992, Williams returned to career-best form for Carlton in 1993 and 1994. He finished second in the Brownlow Medal in 1993, one vote behind winner [[Gavin Wanganeen]]. In 1994, he polled 30 votes to win the award; he was the tenth player to win the Brownlow Medal twice, and the third to do so at different clubs. Additionally in 1994, he won the [[Leigh Matthews Trophy|AFL Players Association MVP Award]] for the second time, becoming the first player to win the award twice; he won the [[Robert Reynolds Trophy]] as Carlton's best and fairest for the only time in his career. He was also All-Australian in both 1993 and 1994 – the former as vice-captain, and the latter as captain.<ref name="blueseum" /> He won the first and only premiership of his VFL/AFL career with Carlton in [[1995 AFL Grand Final|1995]], and he won the [[Norm Smith Medal]] with five goals in the Grand Final. He was the first player to win a Brownlow Medal, Premiership Medallion, and Norm Smith Medal across his career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/124494/default.aspx|title=Medal man|date=1 Oct 2011|accessdate=1 Oct 2011|first=Ashley|last=Browne|publisher=Australian Football League}}</ref>

Williams played two more seasons, before retiring at the end of a controversial 1997 season which saw a [[Greg Williams (Australian footballer)#Controversy|protracted legal battle]] between the AFL and Carlton over a suspension Williams received from the tribunal. He finished his career with 259 senior games: 34 with Geelong, 107 with Sydney, 109 with Carlton and 9 for Victoria in State of Origin matches.<ref name="encyc">{{citation|last1=Holmesby|first1=Russell|first2=Jim|last2=Main|title=The Encyclopedia of AFL Footballers: Every Carlton AFL Player Ever|publisher=BAS Publishing|place=Melbourne, VIC|year=2004|page=206}}</ref> In his league career he accumulated 3600 handpasses, which was more than five hundred more than any other player before him, and remained the record until 2006. His average of 26.9 disposals per game is still the record among all players in league history, and his 14.4 handpasses per game remains the record for retired players; as of the end of 2011, only one active player ([[Daniel Cross (footballer)|Daniel Cross]]) averaged higher more handpasses.{{Ref|2|Note 2, }}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.rleague.com/afl/stats/players.html|title=Player Totals|accessdate=1 Sep 2011|publisher=AFL Tables}}</ref>

*[[Carlton Football Club]] Hall of Fame – inducted 1999
*[[Sydney Swans]] Hall of Fame – inducted 2009

==Controversy==
Williams was a highly controversial figure during his career, and was involved in several scandals.

;Tribunal record
Williams frequently found himself in trouble with umpires and had many [[AFL Tribunal|tribunal]] appearances – often as the result of overzealous retaliation against his taggers.<ref name="encyc" /> He was charged a total of 19 times, found guilty 12 times, and suspended for a total of 34 matches during his career.<ref name="law2">{{cite web|url=http://footystats.freeservers.com/Special/1997review.html|title=1997 Review|publisher=Footystats|accessdate=30 Aug 2011|date=1997}}</ref> He was also known for his generally impolite treatment of umpires, and the Tribunal found him guilty of verbally abusing an umpire on three occasions, for which he was twice fined and once suspended.<ref name="1995f">{{cite web|url=http://footystats.freeservers.com/Special/1995review.html|title=1995 Review|publisher=Footystats|accessdate=31 Aug 2011|date=1995}}</ref>

;Illegal player payments
In February 1992, it was uncovered that both Williams and the Sydney Swans had breached the league's salary regulations. Williams had received additional, undeclared payments via one of Sydney's sponsors during the 1990 season, with both the club and the player aware of the rort. Both plead guilty to the AFL. The club was fined $50,000, and Williams was fined $25,000 and de-registered by the league for eleven weeks. Williams was in his first pre-season with Carlton at the time, and his debut for the club was delayed until Round 7 as a result of the deregistration.<ref name="blueseum" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://footystats.freeservers.com/Special/1992review.html|title=1992 Review|publisher=Footystats|accessdate=31 Aug 2011|date=1992}}</ref>

;1993 Brownlow Medal
When Williams finished one vote behind winner [[Gavin Wanganeen]] for the 1993 Brownlow Medal, it was noted that Williams had received no votes in Carlton's nine goal victory against {{AFL Mel}} in Round 10 – a match in which Williams accumulated 44 disposals and was generally thought to have been the most dominant player on the ground. The votes in that game attracted some media attention at the time, and Williams' poor relationship with umpires was often considered to have been a factor in his failure to poll votes.<ref name="law2">{{cite web|url=http://footystats.freeservers.com/Special/1993review.html|title=1993 Review|publisher=Footystats|accessdate=30 Aug 2011|date=1993}}</ref> In 2006, one of the umpires in that match, Murray Bird, alleged this to be true, stating that he had wanted to award votes to Williams, but that his colleague on the day, Peter Russo, had overruled him on the basis of Williams' negative attitude towards them. Russo denied the allegations. Williams briefly considered a legal challenge for the 1993 Brownlow Medal, but did not proceed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afana.com/drupal5/news/2006/09/27/potential_brownlow_scandal-309|title=Potential Brownlow Scandal|first=Lisa|last=Albergo|date=27 Sep 2006|accessdate=1 Sep 2011|publisher=AFANA}}</ref>

;Racial vilification
In August 1995, Williams was charged with racially vilifying West Coast Eagles opponent [[Chris Lewis (Australian rules footballer)|Chris Lewis]], after referring to him as a "black cunt" during a match; he was the first player charged under an AFL rule, introduced in June 1995, which was specific to racial vilification. The case was settled with a public apology from Williams to Lewis; no penalty was imposed.<ref>{{citation|first=Greg|last=Gardiner|title=Racial Abuse and Football: The
Australian Football League’s Racial Vilification Rule in Review|journal=Sporting Traditions|volume=14|issue=1|date=November 1997|accessdate=31 Aug 2011|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportingTraditions/1997/st1401/st1401d.pdf}}</ref> It was not the only incident between the two players in their careers, with Lewis suspended for spitting at Williams in a match in 1993.<ref name="1995f" />

;Suspension appealed through the courts
Williams was involved in a particularly controversial tribunal case following an incident in Round 1 1997. After the final siren of Carlton's match against Essendon, umpire Andrew Coates stepped in to break up a small conflict between Williams and Essendon's [[Sean Denham]]. Williams pushed Coates in the chest to continue the exchange with Denham. The contact was not violent in nature, but was forceful enough to knock Coates off balance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footy.com.au/dags/97/wrapup/wrapup_r02.html|title=Weekly Wrapup|first=Tim|last=Murphy|date=5 May 1997|accessdate=30 Aug 2011}}</ref> Coates did not report Williams for the incident, but after viewing video footage, the AFL brought its own report against Williams to the tribunal. He was found guilty of "undue interference with an umpire" and suspended for nine matches.

Because the length of the suspension would have personally cost Williams $100,000 in match payments, Carlton decided to challenged the decision in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]]; at the time, there was no Appeals Board at the AFL Tribunal, so the courts were the only place to appeal decisions.<ref name="law1">{{cite web|url=http://www.law4u.com.au/footylaw/footy_law_shearing.html|title=The Supreme Court Hearing|accessdate=30 Aug 2011}}</ref> An injunction against the suspension was awarded on the Friday after the match, allowing Williams to continue playing until the case was heard (although he did have to serve a three week suspension for a kneeing offence committed the very next week). Prior to Round 10, the court overturned the nine week suspension,<ref name="law2" /> with Justice John Hedigan making direct recommendation that the AFL Tribunal establish its own appeals process as part of his judgement.<ref name="law1" /> The AFL then appealed Hedigan's decision in the Victorian Court of Appeal, and the three justices found in the AFL's favour (by a majority of 2–1), and re-instated Williams' nine week suspension, to be served starting in Round 17. Carlton attempted to take the case to the [[High Court of Australia]], but the High Court rejected the application. Altogether, Carlton suffered more than $400,000 in legal costs.<ref name="law2" /> Williams served six matches of the suspension before retiring at the end of the season. The AFL did act on Hedigan's recommendation, and established an Appeals Board for the 1998 season.

==Personal life==
Williams has a son, Jake, who trained with Carlton in the 2007 pre-season, but was ultimately not drafted to the AFL. Jake was eligible to be selected by either Carlton or Sydney under the [[father-son rule]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aflinsider.net/carlton-and-jake-williams/|title=Carlton and Jake Williams|date=1 Oct 2006|accessdate=1 Sep 2011|publisher=AFL Insider}}</ref>
