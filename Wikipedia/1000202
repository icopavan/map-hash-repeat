'''''Salome''''' (or in [[French language|French]]: '''''Salomé''''') is a [[tragedy]] by [[Oscar Wilde]].
The original [[1891]] version of the play was in [[French language|French]]. Three years later an English translation was published. The play tells in one act the Biblical story of [[Salome]], stepdaughter of the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|tetrarch]] [[Herod Antipas]], who, to her stepfather's dismay but to the delight of her mother [[Herodias]], requests the head of Jokanaan ([[John the Baptist]]) on a silver platter as a reward for dancing the [[dance of the seven veils]].

==Versions and premieres==
Rehearsals for the play's debut on the London stage began in 1892, but were halted when the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s licensor of plays banned ''Salomé'' on the basis that it was illegal to depict Biblical characters on the stage. The play was first published in French in 1893, and an English translation, with illustrations by [[Aubrey Beardsley]], in [[1894]]. On the [[Dedication]] page, Wilde indicated that his lover [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] was the translator. In fact, Wilde and Douglas had quarrelled over the latter's translation of the text which had been nothing short of disastrous given his poor mastery of French &mdash; though Douglas claimed that the errors were really in Wilde's original play. Beardsley and the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] got drawn in when they sided with Wilde. In a gesture of reconciliation, Wilde did the work himself but dedicated Douglas as the translator rather than having them sharing their names on the title-page. Douglas compared a dedication to sharing the title-page as "the difference between a tribute of admiration from an artist and a receipt from a tradesman."<ref name="Ellmann">''Oscar Wilde'' by Richard Ellman, published in 1987</ref>

The play was eventually premiered on February 11, 1896, while Wilde was in prison, in [[Paris]] at the [[Théâtre de l'Athénée|Comédie-Parisienne]] in a staging by [[Aurélien Lugné-Poë]]'s theatre group, the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bristow |first=Joseph |year=2009 |pages=96, 106, 193 |title=Oscar Wilde and Modern Culture: The Making of a Legend |location=Athens, Ohio |publisher=Ohio University Press|ISBN=9780821418376}}</ref> In [[Pall Mall Gazette]] of June 29, 1892 Wilde explained, why he had written Salomé in French: 
:"I have one instrument that I know I can command, and that is the English language. There was another instrument to which I had listened all my life, and I wanted once to touch this new instrument to see whether I could make any beautiful thing out of it. [...] Of course, there are modes of expression that a Frenchman of letters would not have used, but they give a certain relief or color to the play. A great deal of the curious effect that [[Maeterlinck]] produces comes from the fact that he, a Flamand by grace, writes in an alien language. The same thing is true of Rossetti, who, though he wrote in English, was essentially Latin in temperament."<ref>cited by Archibald Henderson in [[Overland Monthly]] No. 1, July, 1907. p. 14 [http://www.archive.org/stream/overlandmonthly250sanfrich/overlandmonthly250sanfrich_djvu.txt archive.org]</ref>

A performance of the play was arranged by the New Stage Club at the Bijou Theatre in Archer Street, London, on the 10th and 13th May 1905, starring Millicent Murby as Salome and directed by [[Florence Farr]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilde |first=Oscar |year=1986 |pages=319 |title=The Importance of Being Earnest and other plays |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books Ltd|ISBN=0140482091}}</ref> In June 1906 the play was presented privately with ''[[A Florentine Tragedy]]'' by the Literary Theatre Society at King's Hall, [[Covent Garden]]. The Lord Chamberlain's ban was not lifted for almost forty years; the first public performance of ''Salomé'' in England was at the [[Savoy Theatre]] on October 5, 1931.

In 1992 the play was performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] at the [[Circle in the Square Theatre]], under the direction of Robert Allan Ackerman. [[Sheryl Lee]] starred as the title role alongside [[Al Pacino]]. The play costarred [[Suzanne Bertish]], [[Esai Morales]] and [[Arnold Vosloo]].

==Themes==
Many view Wilde's ''Salomé'' as a superb composite of earlier treatments of the theme overlaid with Belgian playwright [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]'s characteristic methodical diction. Although the "kissing of the head" element was used in [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]] and even Heywood's production, Wilde's ingenuity was to move it to the play's climax. While his debts are undeniable, there are some interesting contributions in Wilde's treatment, most notably being his persistent use of parallels between Salomé and the [[moon]].

Scholars like Nassaar point out that Wilde employs a number of the images favored by Israel's kingly poets and that the moon is meant to suggest the pagan goddess [[Cybele]], who, like Salomé, was obsessed with preserving her virginity and thus took pleasure in destroying male sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Wilde's ''Salomé'' in later art==
{{Main|Music based on the works of Oscar Wilde}}

Wilde's version of the story has since spawned several other artistic works, the most famous of which is [[Richard Strauss]]'s [[opera]] of the [[Salome (opera)|same name]]. The Strauss opera moves the center of interest to Salome, away from [[Herod Antipas]].

In 1906, [[Maud Allan]] created a production entitled "Vision of Salomé", which debuted in Vienna. It was based loosely on Wilde's play. Her version of the Dance of the Seven Veils became famous (and to some notorious) and she was billed as "The Salomé Dancer". A production of the play led to a libel case in 1918, when Allan was accused of promoting sexual immorality.

In 1923, a film adaptation of ''Salomé'' directed by Charles Bryant was released. [[Alla Nazimova]], the Russian/American actress, played the protagonist.

The play, and most of the later filmed versions, have Herod as the center of the action. A strong actor, as with [[Al Pacino]] in his 1980s [[Circle in the Square]] production (and in 2006, in a [[Los Angeles]] production), or as with the [[Ken Russell]] movie ''[[Salome's Last Dance]]'', Herod completely dominates the play.

The 1961 Biblical epic ''[[King of Kings (1961 film)|King of Kings]]'' uses lines of dialogue original to Wilde rather than the Gospel for some scenes involving Herod Antipas, John the Baptist, Herodias and Salome.{{fact|date=February 2012}}

Australian musician [[Nick Cave]] wrote a 5-act play entitled ''Salomé'' which is included in the 1988 collection of Cave's writings, ''King Ink'' (the play alludes to the Gospel account, Wilde's play, and [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]]'s 1869 painting, ''The Beheading of John the Baptist'').

[[Ken Russell]] directed a film version of the play, [[Salome's Last Dance]] (1988), staged as a private performance for Wilde at a brothel.

Also heavily influenced by the play are [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' video for the song "[[Stand Inside Your Love]]" and [[U2]]'s "[[Mysterious Ways (song)|Mysterious Ways]]" and "[[Salome (song)|Salome]]".

Caffe Cino playwright [[Doric Wilson]] wrote a comic re-imagination of Wilde's Salome entitled "Now She Dances!".

In the film [[Trick (film)|Trick]], the character Katherine is in a fictitious variation of Salome that is set in a women's prison. Though, aside from seeing characters in striped prison jumpsuits, no scene from the play is actually seen.

Salome is metaphorically referenced in the anime ''[[Blood+]]''.

Spanish painter Gino Rubert created a series of pictures in 2005.<ref>Spanish ed.: ISBN 8481095117 German edition, Club premiere 2006, without ISBN</ref>

Salome is the title of a track by ''[[Pete Doherty]]'' on his 2009 album ''[[Grace/Wastelands]]'', which shares several lyrical references to Wilde's work.

Salome was played with great success in Paris, at the Théâtre du Nord-Ouest in a very inspired version by stage director Olivier Bruaux (2009). It received a cheerful welcome from the Oscar Wilde Society. It was back on stage at A la Folie Théâtre in Paris from May to mid-July 2010 with a partly renewed cast.

Salome is currently being played for the first time in San Juan, Puerto Rico at the Teatro Francisco Arrivi by theatre company Artefacto.

Throughout the movie and musical [[A Man of No Importance (musical)|A Man of No Importance]], the main character tries to produce the production of Salome in his local church.
