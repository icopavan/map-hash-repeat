'''The Upper Deck Company, LLC''' (colloquially as '''Upper Deck''' and '''Upper Deck Authenticated, Ltd.''' in the UK), founded in 1988, is a [[Privately held company|private company]] primarily known for producing [[trading cards]]. Its headquarters are in [[Carlsbad, California|Carlsbad]], [[California]],<ref>"[http://www.upperdeck.com/hr/faq.aspx F.A.Q.s]." Upper Deck Company. Retrieved on April 17, 2011.

The company also produces sports related items such as figurines and die-cast on top of having exclusive agreements to produce memorabilia (under the brand name [[Upper Deck Authenticated]]) with such sports superstars as [[Michael Jordan]], [[Derek Jeter]], [[Tiger Woods]], [[LeBron James]], [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Andrew Bynum]], [[Albert Pujols]], [[Grady Sizemore]], [[Matt Kemp]], [[James Loney (baseball)|James Loney]], [[Sandy Koufax]] and [[Ken Griffey Jr]]. Under the Upper Deck Entertainment name, the company also produced card games such as World of Warcraft.

==Company history==
[[Image:UpperDeckCompanyLogo.png|thumb|Previous Upper Deck logo used until early 2008]]
On December 23, 1988, Upper Deck was granted a license by [[Major League Baseball]] to produce [[baseball card]]s, and just two months later, on February 23, 1989, delivered its first case of baseball cards to George Moore of Tulsa's Baseball Card Store in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. Upper Deck sold out its baseball cards midway through this inaugural year, then pre-sold its entire 1990 baseball stock before the year began.  

The 1990 set included the industry's first randomly inserted personally [[autograph]]ed and numbered cards of sports superstars. All Upper Deck brands bear an exclusive trademark hologram, and Upper Deck has been named "Card Set of the Year" every year since 1989, ranked number one, and earned favorite brand status with card collectors.<ref name="TCC20050310">{{cite web |url=http://www.tradingcardcentral.com/news/2005/03/10_002.php |title=Upper Deck Chairman Richard McWilliam Honored as Industry's 'Most Influential' Person of the Past 20 Years at Annual Hawaii Trade Conference |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |publisher=Trading Card Central |work=The Upper Deck Co, LLC |date=March 10, 2005 }}</ref>

Paul Sumner created the Upper Deck concept in 1987. He worked in printing sales and came up with the idea for a premium card. When he heard about card counterfeiting, he realized that he knew a way to protect cards. He had studied holograms in college and had used them in printing his company's brochures.<ref name="NYT19931004">{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/04/business/upper-deck-shakes-up-trading-card-industry.html?pagewanted=all |title=Upper Deck Shakes Up Trading-Card Industry |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |date=October 4, 1993 |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |publisher=New York Times}}</ref> He hired [[Robert Young Pelton]] to design and produce a prototype. Pelton designed and produced the cards for Upper Decks first three year rise. After it was discovered that Richard McWilliam was counterfeiting cards Pelton and Sumner had a falling out with accountant McWilliam who seized control of the company.  Pelton's agencies, Pelton & Associates and Digital Artists, were replaced by [[Chiat/Day]]. Paul Sumner resigned with the understanding that he would be known as the "Co-Founder of Upper Deck", something that the company's owner and CEO, [[Richard McWilliam]], recognizes to this day. The early years of Upper Deck and their dramatic crash after Pelton and Sumner left are captured in Pete Williams' book "Card Sharks: How Upper Deck Turned a Child's Hobby into a High-Stakes, Billion-Dollar Business"

On March 20, 1990, The Upper Deck Company was granted licenses by the [[National Hockey League]] and [[National Hockey League Players Association]] to produce hockey cards. The company also obtained licenses from the [[National Football League]] and the [[National Basketball Association]] in 1990, making the Upper Deck Company the first trading card company in 10 years to be licensed by all four leagues. Upper Deck established itself so quickly that it rivaled Topps, which had been considered the standard, and other companies such as Fleer, Donruss and Score. By 1991, the company built a {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} plant of brown marble and black glass on a hilltop {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of San Diego.<ref name="NYT19931004" />

After Upper Deck introduced its premium baseball series, other companies followed with improved photography, better design and higher-quality paper stock. The sports card market grew from $50 million in 1980 when Topps's monopoly was broken by Fleer, to a $1.5 billion industry in 1992.<ref name="NYT19931004" />  Hall of Famer [[Reggie Jackson]], served as an adviser in the early 1990s.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/01/sports/baseball-mr-october-is-now-a-man-for-all-seasons.html?scp=6&sq=?pagewanted=1&pagewanted=3 "BASEBALL; Mr. October Is Now A Man For All Seasons"]</ref>

At the beginning of the [[1992–93 NHL season]], Upper Deck made Patrick Roy a spokesperson. Roy was an ideal choice as he was a hockey card collector, and his collection amounted to over 150,000 cards. An ad campaign was launched and it had an adverse effect on Patrick Roy’s season. Upper Deck had a slogan called “Trade Roy”, and it was posted on billboards throughout the city of Montreal.<ref name="Patrick Roy p. 296">Patrick Roy, winning, nothing else, p. 296, by Michel Roy, translated by Charles Phillips, 2008, John Wiley & Sons, Mississauga, ON, ISBN 978-0-470-15616-2</ref> A ''[[Journal de Montreal]]'' poll, published on January 13, 1993, indicated that 57% of fans favoured trading Patrick Roy.<ref name="Patrick Roy p. 296"/> Before the trading deadline, Canadiens General Manager [[Serge Savard]] insisted that he would consider a trade for Roy.<ref>Patrick Roy, winning, nothing else, p. 297, by Michel Roy, translated by Charles Phillips, 2008, John Wiley & Sons, Mississauga, ON, ISBN 978-0-470-15616-2</ref> The Canadiens ended the season by winning only 8 of their last 19 games.<ref>Patrick Roy, winning, nothing else, p.299, by Michel Roy, translated by Charles Phillips, 2008, John Wiley & Sons, Mississauga, ON, ISBN 978-0-470-15616-2</ref>

Upper Deck was also the first to insert swatches of game-used material into cards when it made jersey cards in 1997 UD Basketball. The insert set was called Game Jersey and a similar set followed in baseball the next year, where UD cut up game-used jerseys of [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], [[Tony Gwynn]] and [[Rey Ordóñez]].

In 1999, Upper Deck Company spent in excess of $1.1 million in acquiring vintage baseball memorabilia items at the [[Barry Halper]] Collection auction held at Sotheby's in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-55918614.html |title=The Upper Deck Company Spends $1.1 Million at Sotheby's Barry Halper Baseball Memorabilia Auction |work=PR Newswire |publisher=HighBeam |date=September 30, 1999 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> One of the items was a Ty Cobb jersey that Upper Deck paid $332,500 for. As part of a sweepstakes prize, it gave the jersey to 14-year-old Robert Shell of Milwaukee. At the time, the estimated tax Robert was going to pay on the prize was $125,000. The amount, his mother said, would force the family to sell the jersey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1019889/index.htm |title=Go Figures |date=August 14, 2000 |first=George |last=Dohrmann |publisher=Sports Illustrated |work=Time Inc. |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

In May 2005, Richard McWilliam was honored at the sports collectible industry's annual trade convention in Hawaii as the industry's "most influential" person of the past 20 years.<ref name="TCC20050310" /> In addition to McWilliam's award, Upper Deck was also recognized for the debut of its legendary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2191533/|title=The enduring popularity (and ubiquity) of the 1989 Upper Deck Ken Griffey Jr. card|date=May 29, 2008|first=Darren|last=Rovell |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> 1989 baseball trading card set, which included the then 19-year-old centerfielder Ken Griffey, Jr., as the "most influential" event of the past 20 years. The list of nominees was created and voted upon by the editorial sports staff of F+W Publications (organizers of the conference and the parent organization of popular collectibles magazines such as ''Sports Collectors Digest'', Trade Fax, Tuff Stuff, and Card Trade).<ref name="TCC20050310" />

In July 2005, Upper Deck won the liquidation auction of former competitor [[Fleer]]-[[SkyBox International]]'s brand name, assets, and business model, as well as the [[Fleer Collectibles]] [[die-cast toy|die-cast]] business assets. In March 2007, Upper Deck made an offer to buy competitor [[Topps]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2881402 |title=Upper Deck, Eisner group both seeking to buy Topps |date=May 24, 2007 |work=The Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> competing with [[Madison Dearborn Partners]] and [[Tornante Company]], the eventual buyer.

Upper Deck originally included the year of the trading card set's release on its logo, with the "19" above "Upper" and the last two digits of the year under "Deck" (but both inside the green diamond). This practice was dropped midway through the 1994 season. In 2008, Upper Deck retired the green diamond logo and replaced it with a new design that it could better use to market all of its products.

In 2009, Upper Deck introduced the Diamond Club. Diamond Club members consist of the top individual purchasers and collectors of Upper Deck and Fleer brands throughout the United States, Canada and Japan. The criteria were that the members distinguished themselves not only by the amount of money they spent, but by how they helped to promote these products within the hobby and to other collectors. Diamond Club members receive special promotional items, receive invitations to special events and are invited to an annual summit where they can share ideas with members of Upper Deck while participating in a special reception with one of the company's spokesmen. Fewer than 125 members are chosen to be a part of the program each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.upperdeck.com/diamondclub.aspx |title=Upper Deck Sports: Diamond Club |publisher=Upper Deck |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

On August 6, 2009, Major League Baseball announced it entered into a multi-year deal with Topps giving it exclusive rights to produce MLB trading cards. Upper Deck will retain its rights to produce cards bearing player likenesses via its contract with the MLBPA but will be unable to use team logos or other trademarked images. On February 1, 2010, Major League Baseball filed a federal lawsuit against Upper Deck for trademark infringement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2010/02/01/2010-02-01_major_league_baseball_properties_filed_federal_lawsuit_against_upper_deck_for_tr.html |title=Major League Baseball Properties filed federal lawsuit against Upper Deck for trademark infringement |first=Michael |last=O'Keeffe |date=February 1, 2010 |publisher=NY Daily News |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> A mutual settlement was announced on March 3, 2010, stating that Upper Deck could continue selling its three current baseball card series (2009 Signature Stars, 2009 Ultimate Collection and 2010 Upper Deck Series One), although they are prohibited from using any MLB trademarks (including team logos and names) in any of their future baseball products. Despite this limitation, Upper Deck commented that they would still continue to produce baseball-related cards without the use of those trademarks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.upperdeck.com/news/article.aspx?aid=7577 |title=Upper Deck Settles Lawsuit with Major League Baseball |date=March 3, 2010 |publisher=Upper Deck |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

On September 29, 2009, Upper Deck created the company's first-ever packs of Finnish and Swedish language Victory hockey cards to go on sale in those markets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upperdeck.com/marketing/news_article.aspx?aid=6781 |title=Upper Deck Celebrates NHL Premiere Games; Expands Hockey Business into Sweden, Finland |date=September 29, 2009 |publisher=Upper Deck |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

In February 2010, Blizzard Entertainment ended its licensing deal with Upper Deck. Upper deck had previously produced its World of Warcraft game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brian.carnell.com/articles/2010/upper-deck-loses-world-of-warcraft-tcg-license/ |title=Upper Deck Loses World of Warcraft TCG License |first=Brian |last=Carnell |date=March 4, 2010 |publisher=Brian Carnell |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

On April 7, 2010, Upper Deck announced it will no longer be licensed to produce NFL trading cards.  Upper Deck spokesperson Terry Melia noted on his twitter account that, "UD was unable to come to terms with NFL Properties. No NFL Properties-licensed football cards from UD in 2010."  Upper Deck owner Richard McWilliam said, "Over the past year, Upper Deck has attempted to negotiate a new licensing deal with NFL Properties.  Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were not able to reach agreeable terms, and therefore will not be issuing any NFL Properties-licensed trading cards for the 2010 season. Upper Deck will continue to focus on its exclusive license agreement with the Collegiate Licensing Company and co-exclusive agreements with NHL Enterprises and the NHL Players Association, as well as its multiple entertainment licenses.”<ref>{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/group/185224/?tab=tabArticles&p=1065016#ViewArticle |title=Upper Deck loses NFL card license |first=Chris |last=Olds |date=April 7, 2010 |publisher=Beckett |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

===DeWayne Buice===
[[DeWayne Buice]], then a California Angels pitcher, would later become one of Upper Deck's founding partners. In November 1987, Buice walked into The Upper Deck, a trading card store.  Store owner Bill Hemrick noticed Buice and the two struck up a friendship, one that led to Buice's hosting an autograph session at the store.  Within weeks, Buice had become one of Hemrick's business partners.<ref name="ESPN20030807">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/sportsbusiness/s/2003/0807/1591961.html |title='Hungry' journeyman Buice enjoys his millions |first=Darren |last=Rovell |accessdate=May 22, 2010 |publisher=EPSN}}</ref>
Hemrick and his partner Paul Sumner were in the process of starting Upper Deck. Unfortunately, the two lacked the business and personal connections to help land the necessary Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) license, which would allow Upper Deck to use players' names and likenesses on its cards. The only response they received was that the players' union was not accepting another card company for three more years. Buice was told that if he could help secure the license, he would receive a 12 percent stake in the card company.  Buice would become a key figure in getting MLBPA officials to agree to a meeting. By the end of the 1988 season, Hemrick and Sumner received the license and by 1989, were making baseball cards.<ref name="ESPN20030807" />

By the time Buice retired from professional baseball at the end of the 1989 season, he had collected $2.8 million from Upper Deck.  Believing the company owed him even more money, Buice sued Upper Deck executives.  After the battle over Buice's stake in the company was settled in court, he became a millionaire who reportedly made $17 million on the deal, far more than he ever made as a baseball player. In two-and-a-half seasons with the Angels, Buice made $212,500.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/buicede01.shtml |title=DeWayne Buice Statistics and History |publisher=Baseball Reference |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

Upper Deck was originally scheduled to pay Buice his millions over a four-year period, but due to the [[1994 baseball strike]], Upper Deck's business stalled. Buice then agreed to a six-year payment plan.  Sales in 1995 and 1996 fell so far that for those two years, virtually all the company's profits went to Buice.<ref name="ESPN20030807" />

On the day in 1998 that Upper Deck cut Buice his final check, the company threw a party at its Carlsbad, California, headquarters. The top brass ordered employees to work just a half day.  Later that year at the Christmas party, Upper Deck CEO [[Richard McWilliam]] told employees the company's deal with Buice was the worst deal it had ever done.<ref name="ESPN20030807" />

===1989 set and Ken Griffey, Jr.===
In the 1989 Upper Deck baseball set, Ken Griffey, Jr. was selected to be featured on card number one.<ref name="Mint Condition p.167">Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.167, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, ISBN 978-0-8021-1939-1</ref> The decision to make Griffey, Jr. the first card was reached in late 1988.

A teenage employee named Tom Geideman was the one who suggested the use of Griffey as its Number one.<ref>Mint Condition: How Baseball Cards Became an American Obsession, p.166, Dave Jamieson, 2010, Atlantic Monthly Press, imprint of Grove/Atlantic Inc., New York, NY, ISBN 978-0-8021-1939-1</ref> Traditionally, Topps had a system for reserving various numbers in their sets (such as numbers 1 and 100) for the biggest stars in the game. Geideman decided that a top prospect should be honored with the number one card in the inaugural 1989 set. After reviewing Baseball America, Geideman narrowed the list of candidates to four: [[Gregg Jefferies]] of the New York Mets, [[Gary Sheffield]] of the Milwaukee Brewers, [[Sandy Alomar, Jr.]] of the San Diego Padres, and Ken Griffey, Jr. Geideman was a Mariners fan and decided that Ken Griffey, Jr. should be the prospect featured on card number one of the 1989 set.<ref name="Mint Condition p.167"/>  

At press time, Griffey had not yet played a major league game, so Upper Deck used an image of Griffey in a [[San Bernardino Spirit]] uniform.<ref name="Mint Condition p.167"/> Competitors such as Score and Topps neglected to include a card of Griffey in its regular 1989 set. Both brands would make a card of Griffey in their end of year Traded sets. Such neglect helped Upper Deck gain exposure due to the popularity of Griffey in the [[1989 MLB season]].

Despite the popularity of the Griffey card, it was not a scarce card. The card was situated in the top left hand corner of the uncut sheets and was more liable to be cut poorly or have its corners dinged. Company policy was that if a customer found a damaged card in its package, the company would replace it.<ref name="Mint Condition p.167"/> Many Griffey cards were returned and the result was that Upper Deck printed many uncut sheets (sheets consisting of 100 cards) of just Ken Griffey, Jr.<ref name="Mint Condition p.167"/> According to Professional Sports Authenticator, the Ken Griffey, Jr. would become the most graded card of all time with the company. PSA graded over 50,000 of the cards. The Beckett Grading card service has evaluated over 25,000 of the Ken Griffey, Jr. rookie cards.<ref name="Mint Condition p.167"/>

==High end sports cards and insert sets==
===Memorabilia & Relic Cards===
Upper Deck has changed its practice of using materials certified as "Worn" by the player depicted on the front of the card.  The changed wording on the backs of Upper Deck insert cards makes it less clear as to how the materials were used or what player wore the item. 

*EXAMPLE: '''[[Steve Nash]] card 2004'''... (Back of card) On the front of this card is an authentic piece of a jersey WORN by Steve Nash as a member of the Dallas Mavericks in an NBA game.

*EXAMPLE: '''[[Jermaine O'Neal]] card 2006 Exquisite'''...(Back of card) On the front of this is a piece of memorabilia that has been certified to us as having been USED in an NBA game.

Upper Deck has also stopped adding the word "Jersey" to the fronts of game-used insert cards.  The company no longer acknowledges exactly what kind of material was inserted into the cards or how the item was used, and it has eliminated statements claiming the player pictured on the card front actually wore the inserted material.   

Upper Deck's authenticity has been questioned in regards to players' jersey and uniform materials.  The cards state the inserted items are known to Upper Deck to have been used or worn, but since most of the gear is acquired through third parties, the actual use is unknown.  Most of Upper Deck's jersey materials are harvested at events like rookie photo shoots, etc..   During such events, players often change shirts dozens of times to generate event-worn uniform material that never sees the field of play.

Collectors still debate and question the authenticity of such 'memorabilia", which often includes items manufactured specifically for insert cards, patches, and other desirable content.

===NBA Exquisite Collection===
Upper Deck premiered its ''[[National Basketball Association|NBA]] Exquisite Collection'' line in the 2003–2004 season. Each pack contained five [[basketball]] cards; one veteran base card numbered to 225, one autographed rookie card featuring a piece of patch worn by the player numbered to 99 or 225, one game worn jersey card, one autographed/patch insert card, and a fifth card that was either a low numbered parallel or an additional autographed patch card. Suggested retail price of the product was [[United States dollar|$]]500, making it the most expensive basketball card product ever produced at the time. (The few packs that remain unopened now sell for over $4,000.) Autograph cards include veterans such as Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Carmelo Anthony. The most sought after cards from the line include the autographed/patch rookie cards numbered to 99 (LeBron James, Darko Milicic, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and Udonis Haslem), the Limited Logos inserts which feature an extra large jersey patch piece and autograph, and the autographed/patch rookie parallels serial numbered to the player's jersey number.

===Other Exquisite Collections===
In view of the Exquisite series' success, the company has released 2004–05 and 2005–06 basketball sets, a 2005 football line, and an analogous 2005–06 hockey line called The Cup. The football line, which includes autographed rookie "patch" cards, is the most popular of the series.  Variants of these cards, called the Gold Series, are limited to runs of 25 or 99 cards.  The company's Exquisite-branded baseball series were introduced first as premiums in lower-end Upper Deck products (including the company's SP Legendary Cuts and Artifacts Baseball lines).  In late 2007, the company added another line to its Exquisite Collections brand, focused on rookie players.  This recent addition is retailed at $249 USD per pack.

===Baseball Yankee Stadium Legacy===
The Yankee Stadium Legacy set is a 6,742-card compilation chronicling every single game ever played at Yankee Stadium. The card set was manufactured by [[Upper Deck]] and made its official debut by being inserted in random packs of Upper Deck's 2008 Series 1 Baseball.<ref name="sports.upperdeck.com">{{cite web|url=http://sports.upperdeck.com/news/article.aspx?aid=3776 |title=Upper Deck Releases Record-Setting Card Collection: The Yankee Stadium Legacy Set! |date=January 18, 2008 |publisher=Upper Deck |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

Other cards in the set commemorate some of the most famous sporting events that have taken place at Yankee Stadium. Some of these events include: Lou Gehrig's "Luckiest Man Alive" Speech (July 4, 1939); Babe Ruth's "Final Visit to Yankee Stadium" (June 11, 1948); Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling heavyweight title bout (June 19, 1936, Schmeling won), the 1958 NFL Championship between the New York Giants and the Baltimore Colts and Muhammad Ali's title defense against Ken Norton (Sept. 28, 1976).

The Guinness World Book of Records will certify The Yankee Stadium Legacy as the largest baseball card set ever produced, once all the cards are released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportscards.about.com/b/2008/01/19/yankee-stadium-legacy-set-aims-to-be-largest-baseball-card-set-ever.htm |title=Yankee Stadium Legacy Set Aims to be Largest Baseball Card Set Ever |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=About |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> The official recognition will take place only after all of the 6,500 cards are released in Upper Deck's various baseball card launches throughout the year.<ref name="sports.upperdeck.com"/>

The various sets where the Yankee Stadium Legacy cards were inserted into were: Spectrum; Piece of History; SPx; Upper Deck Series Two; SP Legendary Cuts (Hobby-only); SP Authentic; UDx; and UD Masterpieces. Upper Deck started a website so that collectors could find out more about the Yankee Stadium Legacy set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.upperdeck.com/baseball/yankeestadium |title=Yankee Stadium Legacy |publisher=Upper Deck |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> Alphanumeric codes found on the backs of Yankee Stadium Legacy cards can be entered at the site, and collectors would be able to use the site to manage their collections online, and track their collections against other collectors via a leader board.

Tommy Baxter, a 36-year-old from Little Rock, Arkansas, was the first collector to put together Upper Deck’s Yankee Stadium Legacy (YSL) Collection. Baxter was an avid Cubs fan, and seized the opportunity to become the first collector to piece together the insert set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/6600-card-yankee-stadium-legacy-set-complete/ |title=6,600 Card Yankee Stadium Legacy Set: Complete |date=November 24, 2008 |publisher=Sports Collectors Daily |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

===NHL Biography of a Season===
The NHL Biography of a Season cards was a 30-card set capturing the greatest moments of the [[2008-09 NHL Season]]. The cards were available through Upper Deck Certified Diamond Dealers. A collector had to redeem 5 wrappers of 2008/2009 Upper Deck hockey cards at a participating hobby store and receive an exclusive Upper Deck Biography of a Season card.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.upperdeck.com/hockey/biographyseason/default.aspx |title=Upper Deck Sports: NHL Biography of a Season |publisher=Upper Deck |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> One new card was available every week throughout the NHL season. The first four cards were:
*Alexander Ovechkin - NHL single-season record 65 goals by LW
*Henrik Zetterberg - 2008 Conn Smyth winner
*Detroit Red Wings - Stanley Cup team photo
*Steven Stamkos - 1st overall pick in 2008 Draft

The 1,170-card set will pack out across four 2009 Upper Deck basketball products: Lineage (April 1); Radiance (April 29); Upper Deck (Sept. 22); and First Edition (Sept. 29). Each of the cards will include MJ’s specific box score stats from the game in question. Every card in the set will be given some historical significance as the overall set captures every game Jordan ever played with the Bulls, regular-season and playoff battles included. The cards will fall, on average, 1:4 packs across all four brands.

In addition to the 1,170 Jordan game cards, Upper Deck also included 100 different game-used memorabilia cards, each one crash-numbered to 23.

With offices in Berlin, Paris, London, Milan, Tokyo, Sydney and São Paulo the company is optimally organized for distribution across the globe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upperdeck-international.com/ |title=Upperdeck International |publisher=Upper Deck |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>

===Upper Deck Kids===
In April 2006, Upper Deck created Upper Deck Kids with the slogan "Get More Than Lucky". Codes printed on the back of cards can be entered on the website to get points which can be redeemed for prizes. In April 2007, a monthly limit of 1000 codes was installed and adults were made ineligible to sign up. New prizes are usually added weekly. Prizes available in the past included autographed memorabilia, sports card boxes, screensavers, desktop wallpapers, video games & systems, among others.The website also encourages you to buy sports cards. Each prize is worth a different amount. Upper Deck Kids also has message boards where kids can talk about sports, trade codes, and gossip, etc. Also, a limit has been put on how many invalid codes you can enter. This due to multiple hackers that wrote code cracking programs in order to guess all of the possible codes and take all of the prizes for themselves. Additionally, 2006 Upper Deck product's codes may no longer be redeemed for points on the kids website due to avoid "code sharing" amongst members. These 06' codes are often referred to as "accident codes". Code sharing is massive lists of free codes posted on third party sites that can be used to redeem huge amounts of points. Trading codes also takes place on the website as well. Also, in order to encourage kids to buy the most recent Upper Deck products, codes from the backs of cards that are older than six months now are worth half of their original rewards points value.

==Lawsuits==
Under the executive direction of McWilliam, Upper Deck became known as a litigious company. Stars like Mickey Mantle, Karim Abdul-Jabbar and Ted Williams, Upper Deck employees, vendors and even licensors were forced to the courts to settle simple disputes with McWilliam. Pelton & Associates successfully froze all of Upper Deck's product shipments after they proved to the court that they actually owned the custom logos, designs and packaging and that Upper Deck had not paid them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  

Konami - After Upper Deck admitted to counterfeiting cards, the lawsuit was settled out of court.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

MLB - filed a federal lawsuit in New York against Upper Deck, accusing the company of trademark infringement and illegally selling cards that feature official team logos and uniforms. The complaint also notes that Upper Deck owes MLB $2.4 million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} 

Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Upper Deck used six photos of Abdul-Jabbar during his college years without permission. The photos were part of a trading card series called "Greats of the Game," which also had Adul-Jabbar's name and signature.
"Abdul-Jabbar never authorized the production of the cards," the suit reads according to Courthouse News. "In fact, at all times, Upper Deck was fully aware that Abdul-Jabbar had never authorized Upper Deck to use his photograph, name and signature for college-themed cards, and Abdul-Jabbar had previously rejected Upper Deck's request for such authorization."
Upper Deck has yet to respond to the allegations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

American International Specialty Lines Insurance Company - This appeal (12-11-2008) arises out of an insurance policy that The Upper Deck Corporation (“Upper Deck”), purchased from American International Specialty Lines Insurance Company (“AISLIC”). The policy insured a tax strategy that KPMG, an accounting firm, developed for Upper Deck. The IRS investigated the tax strategy and determined that it constituted an improper tax shelter. Upper Deck then settled with the IRS for $80 million in back taxes and interest, and with the California Franchise Tax Board for $17 million in back taxes and interest.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

After AISLIC rejected Upper Deck’s claim that the policy covered the loss incurred as a result of the settlement, Upper Deck and its Chief Executive Officer, Richard McWilliam, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that the policy issued by AISLIC covered the loss. Subsequently, the district court granted AISLIC’s motion to compel arbitration.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

A three-member panel of arbitrators held that Upper Deck and McWilliam were not entitled to coverage because Upper Deck had abandoned the tax strategy that AISLIC had insured. The district court confirmed the arbitration award.<ref>http://www.morelaw.com/verdicts/case.asp?d=38290&n=07-56070&s=CA</ref>
