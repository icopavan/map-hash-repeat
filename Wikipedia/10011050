The '''Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network''' (EMHRN, [[French language|French]]: '''Réseau euro-mediterranéen des droits de l'Homme''') is a network of 64 [[human rights]] organisations, institutions and individuals based in 30 countries in [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] region. It was established in 1997 in response to the '''Barcelona Declaration''', which led to the establishment of the [[Euromediterranean Partnership|Euro-Mediterranean Partnership]]. 

The members of the EMHRN admit to universal human rights principles and are convinced of the value of cooperation and dialogue across and within borders. The EMHRN promotes networking, cooperation and development of partnerships between human rights [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], [[Activism|activists]] and a wider civil society.

==Aims and achievements==
The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network was created in relation to the existence of the inter-governmental [[Euromediterranean Partnership]] (EMP), and in particular, the [[Euromediterranean_Partnership#Barcelona_Process|Barcelona Process]] proposed by the EMP. The EMHRN's role is primarily as an intermediary between governmental institutions and grassroots human rights organisations. It received most of its funding during its first years from governmental sources and is closely linked to the EuroMed Civil Forums that constitutes a relatively government-linked alternative to the grassroots Alternative Mediterranean Conference that was organised in 1995. As of 2008, the EMHRN had become well recognised both by [[European Union]] (EU) institutions and NGOs. Its activities range from communication among NGO members and activist campaigning through to lobbying of institutions. The effectiveness of its range of grassroots through to lobbying strategies remain unclear.<ref name="vanhullen_general">{{cite web| last =van Hüllen | first =Vera| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Transnationalising Euromediterranean Relations: The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network as an Intermediary Actor| work =| publisher =| date =2008-11| url =http://www.euromedalex.org/sites/default/files/vanHuellen.pdf |format =| doi =| accessdate =2010-06-28 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5qp8eafmD |archivedate=2010-06-28 |deadurl=no}} ([http://www.euromedalex.org/node/11270 cover page])</ref>

The EMHRN describes itself as a regional forum for human rights NGOs and a pool of expertise on promotion, protection and strengthening of human rights. It states that it brings people together in inter-cultural settings to promote dialogue and understanding, with stress on the following subjects:<ref name="emhrn_aims">http://www.euromedrights.net/17</ref>
* lobbying '''human rights mechanisms''' within the [[European Union]] (EU) and the [[Euromediterranean Partnership]], exspecially concerning the [[European Union Association Agreement|association agreements]] with the Mediterranean Partners and the [[European Neighbourhood Policy]]
* supporting '''reform processes''' in the [[Arab World]] by strengthening [[democratization]] processes originating from the [[civil society]]
* working towards transforming the non-European Mediterranean region into '''[[Rechtsstaat|states of law]]''', especially by backing movements for the enforcement of the [[freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]]
* bringing '''human rights values and principles''' as well as [[women rights]] and the idea of [[public education]] to the public in order to achieve a broad popular participation in changing the living conditions where human rights are abused or denied
* sending of '''delegations and [[Observer status|observers]]''', and publishing urgent alerts in cases of deterioration of human rights and when members are in danger or imprisoned
* close and critical monitoring of the own '''efforts of the EU''' 
* '''information''' on human rights violations in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] by publishing reports, policy papers and newsletters
* '''research and training''' by means of training seminars and workshops

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}

*'''December 1997''': The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network was founded during a meeting at the [[Danish Institute for Human Rights|Danish Centre for Human Rights]] (DHRC) in [[Copenhagen]] by a group of human rights activists from the North and the South of the [[Mediterranean]]. Founding people were then director of the DHRC, [[Morten Kjaerum]], and [[Said Essoulami]] from [[Morocco|Moroccan]] human rights organisation ''[[Centre for Media Freedom in the Middle East and North Africa|CMF-MENA]]''. Further participants in the founding assembly (but no members of the EMHRN) were the [[Dutch Council for Refugees]], the [[Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights]], and the [[European Council on Refugees and Exiles]].

*'''1999''': The network co-organised the [[EuroMed Civil Forum]] in [[Stuttgart]].

*'''2000''': The EMHRN received a European Union funding contract. On its fourth General Assembly in [[Marseille]], a new action plan was adopted, which saw the network multiplying its activities.  In the following years, an office in [[Brussels]] was opened and preparations for offices in [[Rabat]] and [[Amman]] were taken. More staff in addition to the Executive Director were hired.<ref name="vanhullen_general" />

*'''2006''': During the [[European Ministerial Conference]] in [[Istanbul]] a five-year plan for promotion of the role of the women in society was adopted, which included proposals carried out by the EMHRN.
