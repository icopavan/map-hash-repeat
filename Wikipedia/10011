An '''epistolary novel''' <!---or the original [[German language|German]] '''Briefroman'''---> is a [[novel]] written as a series of documents. The usual form is [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, although [[diary|diary entries]], [[newspaper]] clippings and other documents are sometimes used. Recently, electronic "documents" such as recordings and radio, [[blogs]], and [[e-mails]] have also come into use. The word ''[[wikt:epistolary|epistolary]]'' is derived through [[Latin]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ἐπιστολή ''epistolē'', meaning a letter (see [[epistle]]).

The epistolary form can add greater [[realism (arts)|realism]] to a story, because it mimics the workings of real life. It is thus able to demonstrate differing points of view without recourse to the device of an [[omniscient narrator]].

==Early works==
There are two theories on the genesis  of the epistolary novel. The first claims that the genre originated from novels with inserted letters, in which the portion containing the third person narrative in between the letters was gradually reduced.<ref>E.Th. Voss. ''Erzählprobleme des Briefromans, dargestellt an vier Beispielen des 18. Jahrhunderts.'' Bonn, 1960.</ref> The other theory claims that the epistolary novel arose from miscellanies of letters and poetry: some of the letters were tied together into a (mostly amorous) plot.<ref>B.A. Bray. ''L'art de la lettre amoureuse: des manuels aux romans (1550-1700).'' La Haye/Paris, 1967</ref>   Both claims have some validity. The first truly epistolary novel, the Spanish "Prison of Love" (''Cárcel de amor'') (c.1485) by Diego de San Pedro, belongs to a tradition of novels in which a large number of inserted letters already dominated the narrative. Other well-known examples of early epistolary novels are closely related to the tradition of letter-books and miscellanies of letters. Within the successive editions of [[Edmé Boursault]]'s ''Letters of Respect, Gratitude and Love'' (''Lettres de respect, d'obligation et d 'amour'') (1669), a group of letters written to a girl named Babet was expanded and became more and more distinct from the other letters, until it formed a small epistolary novel entitled ''Letters to Babet'' (''Lettres à Babet''). The immensely famous ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun]]'' (''Lettres portugaises'') (1669) generally attributed  to  [[Gabriel-Joseph de La Vergne, comte de Guilleragues]], though a small minority still regard [[Marianna Alcoforado]] as the author, is claimed to be intended to be part of a miscellany of Guilleragues prose and poetry.<ref>G. de [[Guilleragues]]. ''Lettres portugaises, Valentins et autres oeuvres.'' Paris, 1962</ref>
The founder of the epistolary novel in English is said by many to be James Howell (1594–1666) with "Familiar Letters", who writes of prison, foreign adventure, and the love of women.

The first novel to expose the complex play that the genre allows was [[Aphra Behn]]'s [[Love-Letters Between a Nobleman and His Sister]] (1684), which appeared in three successive volumes in 1684, 1685, and 1687. The novel shows the genre's results of changing perspectives: individual points were presented by the individual characters, and the central voice of the author and moral evaluation disappeared (at least in the first volume; her further volumes introduced a narrator). Behn furthermore explored a realm of intrigue with letters that fall into the wrong hands, with faked letters, with letters withheld by protagonists, and even more complex interaction.

The epistolary novel as a genre became popular in the 18th century in the works of such authors as [[Samuel Richardson]], with his immensely successful novels ''[[Pamela (novel)|Pamela]]'' (1740) and ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1749). In [[France]], there was ''[[Lettres persanes]]'' (1721) by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], followed by ''[[Julie, ou la nouvelle Héloïse]]'' (1761) by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], and [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Laclos]]' ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' (1782), which used the epistolary form to great dramatic effect, because the sequence of events was not always related directly or explicitly. In [[Germany]], there was [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774) (''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'') and [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s ''[[Hyperion (Hölderlin)|Hyperion]]''. The first North American novel, ''The History of Emily Montague'' (1769) by [[Frances Brooke]] was written in epistolary form.

Starting in the 18th century, the epistolary form was subject to much ridicule, resulting in a number of savage [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesque]]s. The most notable example of these was [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[Shamela]]'' (1741), written as a parody of ''Pamela''. In it, the female narrator can be found wielding a pen and scribbling her diary entries under the most dramatic and unlikely of circumstances.

The epistolary novel slowly fell out of use in the late 18th century.  Although [[Jane Austen]] tried her hand at the epistolary in juvenile writings and her [[novella]] ''Lady Susan'', she abandoned this structure for her later work.   It is thought that her  lost novel "First Impressions", which was redrafted to become [[Pride and Prejudice]], may have been epistolary: Pride and Prejudice contains an unusual number of letters quoted in full and some play a critical role in the plot.

The epistolary form nonetheless saw continued use, surviving in exceptions or in fragments in nineteenth-century novels. In [[Honoré de Balzac]]'s novel ''Letters of Two Brides'', two women who became friends during their education at a convent correspond over a 17 year period, exchanging letters describing their lives. [[Mary Shelley]] employs the epistolary form in her novel [[Frankenstein]] (1818). Shelley uses the letters as one of a variety of framing devices, as the story is presented through the letters of a sea captain and scientific explorer attempting to reach the north pole who encounters Victor Frankenstein and records the dying man's narrative and confessions. In the late 19th century, [[Bram Stoker]] released one of the most widely recognized and successful novels in the epistolary form to date, [[Dracula]]. Printed in 1897, the novel is compiled entirely of letters, diary entries, newspaper clippings, telegrams, doctor's notes, ship's logs, and the like, which Stoker adroitly employs to balance believability and dramatic tension{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

==Types of epistolary novels==
There are three types of epistolary novels: monologic (giving the letters of only one character, like ''Letters of a Portuguese Nun''), dialogic (giving the letters of two characters, like Mme [[Marie Jeanne Riccoboni]]'s ''Letters of Fanni Butlerd'' (1757), and polylogic (with three or more letter-writing characters). In addition, a crucial element in polylogic epistolary novels like ''Clarissa'', and ''Dangerous Liaisons'' is the dramatic device of 'discrepant awareness': the simultaneous but separate correspondences of the heroines and the villains creating dramatic tension.

Epistolary novels have made several memorable appearances in more recent literature:

* [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] used the epistolary format for his first novel, ''[[Poor Folk]]'' (1846), as a series of letters between two friends, struggling to cope with their impoverished circumstances and life in pre-revolution Russia.
*''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' (1848) by [[Anne Brontë]] is written in the form of letter from the narrator to his friend with the main heroine's diary inside it.
* ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868) by [[Wilkie Collins]] uses a collection of various documents to construct a detective novel in English. In the second piece, a character explains that he is writing his portion because another had observed to him that the events surrounding the disappearance of a certain moonstone might reflect poorly on the family, if misunderstood, and therefore he was collecting the true story. This is an unusual element. Most epistolary novels present the documents without questions about how they were gathered.  He also used the form previously in ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' (1859).
* Spanish foreign minister [[Juan Valera y Alcalá-Galiano|Juan Valera's]] ''Pepita Jimenez'' (1874) is writing in three sections, with the first and third being a series of letters, while the middle part is a narration by an unknown observer.
* [[Jean Webster]]'s ''[[Daddy-Long-Legs (novel)|Daddy-Long-Legs]]'' (1912)
* [[Kathrine Taylor]]'s ''[[Kathrine_Taylor#Address_Unknown_.281938.29|Address Unknown]]'' (1938) was an anti-Nazi novel in which the final letter is returned as "Address Unknown", indicating the disappearance of the German character.
* [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) uses not only letters and diaries, but also dictation [[Phonograph cylinder|cylinders]] and [[newspaper]] accounts. While the novel draws on the epistolary form, by the end of the story it reduces it, along with other media, to a monstrous "mass of typewriting".
* [[C. S. Lewis]] used the epistolary form for ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'' (1942), and considered writing a companion novel from an [[angel]]'s point of view—though he never did so.  It is less generally realized that his ''[[Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer]]'' (1964) was a similar exercise, exploring theological questions through correspondence addressed to a fictional recipient, "Malcolm", though this work may be considered a "novel" only loosely in that developments in Malcolm's personal life gradually come to light and impact the discussion.
* [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s short novel, ''[[Some of Your Blood]]'' (1961), consists of letters and case-notes relating to the psychiatric treatment of a non-supernatural vampire.
* [[Saul Bellow]]'s novel ''[[Herzog]]'' (1964) is largely written in letter format. These are both real and imagined letters, written by the protagonist Moses E. Herzog to family members, friends and famous figures.
*"The Anderson Tapes" (1969, 1970) by Lawrence Sanders is a novel told primarily in the form of transcripts of tape recordings.
* [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' (1974) is written in an epistolary structure, through newspaper clippings, magazine articles, letters, and excerpts from books.
*"The Fan" (1977) by Bob Randall is a thriller in epistolary form.
*In [[John Barth]]'s epistolary work, ''[[LETTERS (novel)|Letters]]'' (1979), the author interacts with characters from his other novels.
* [[Alice Walker]] employed the epistolary form in ''[[The Color Purple]]'' (1982). The 1985 film adaptation echoed the form by incorporating into the script some of the novel's letters, which the actors spoke as monologues.
* [[Edward Irving Wortis|Avi]] used this style of constructing a story in ''[[Nothing But the Truth (novel)|Nothing But the Truth]]'' (1991), where the plot is told using only documents, letters, and scripts.
* [[Ronald Munson]] used an epistolary style in "Fan Mail" (1994), where the entire plot is told using e-mails, letters, transcripts of television shows and telephone conversations, faxes, and interactions with a computer program called [[ELIZA]].
* ''[[The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]'' (1999) was written by [[Stephen Chbosky]] in the form of letters from an anonymous character to a secret role model of sorts.
* [[Richard B. Wright]]'s ''[[Clara Callan]]'' (2001) uses letters and journal entries to weave the story of a middle-aged woman in the 1930s.
* ''[[The Boy Next Door (novel)|The Boy Next Door]]'' (2002) by [[Meg Cabot]] is a romantic comedy novel dealt with entirely by emails sent among the characters.
* ''[[Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography]]'' (2002) by [[Lemony Snicket]]/[[Daniel Handler]] uses letters, documents, and other scripts to construct the plotline.
* Several of [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novels are written in the forms of diaries, letters, or memoirs.
* ''[[We Need to Talk about Kevin]]'' (2003) is a monologic epistolary novel, written as a series of letters to the narrator's husband Franklin.
* In the [[Ross O'Carroll-Kelly]] novels, out-of-context [[text messages]], usually humorous, mark transitions between sections.
* ''[[Griffin and Sabine]]'' by artist [[Nick Bantock]] is a love story written as a series of hand painted postcards and letters.
* ''The Confessions of Max Tivoli'' by Andrew Sean Greer - 2004
*''Where Rainbows End'' (2004) by [[Cecelia Ahern]] is written in the form of letters, emails, instant messages, newspaper articles, etc.
*''Uncommon Valour'' (2005) by John Stevens, the story of two naval officers in 1779, is primarily written in the form of diary and log extracts.
* ''[[World War Z|World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]]'' (2006) by [[Max Brooks]] is a series of interviews from various survivors of a [[zombie apocalypse]].
* ''My Sister's a Pop Star'' (2006), ''I'm SO Not a Pop Star'' (2008), and the third book in the series, ''My Life on TV'' (2010), by American author [[Usborne Publishing|Kimberly Greene]], use blog posts to move the plot along and introduce key changes in the protagonist's thinking.
*''[[The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society]]'' (2008) by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows is written as a series of letters and telegraphs sent and received by the protagonist.
*''Punkzilla'' by Adam Rapp (2009)
*''Super Sad True Love Story'' (2010) by [[Gary Shteyngart]]
*''Burley Cross Postbox Theft'' (2010) by [[Nicola Barker]] is a polylogic epistolary novel consisting of a bundle of 26 undelivered letters stolen from a mailbox in the titular village of Burley Cross.
*''Midnight Movie'' (2011) by [[Tobe Hooper]] and [[Alan Goldsher]] is written as a series of emails, Tweets, texts, and oral histories.
*The children's book ''Regarding the Fountain'' by Kate Klise is told through letters and newspaper clippings.
*''The Antagonist'' (2011) by [[Lynn Coady]] is a monologic epistolary novel conveyed through increasingly unanswered email messages.

==In other media==
* "[[Dear Dad]]", episode twelve of the first season of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', used the framing device of a letter written by [[Hawkeye Pierce]] to his father to describe the events of the episode.
* "[[The Stackhouse Filibuster]]", episode seventeen of the second season of ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'', used the framing device of emails sent by [[C.J. Cregg]], [[Josh Lyman]] and [[Sam Seaborn]] to their respective parents to describe the events of the episode.
*The Beatles' "P.S. I Love You", [[Eminem|Eminem's]] "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]", [[Leonard Cohen|Leonard Cohen's]] "[[Famous Blue Raincoat]]" and [[Bloodhound Gang|Bloodhound Gang's]] "The Ballad of Chasey Lain" are all examples of epistolary songs.
*[[Thomas Bailey Aldrich]]'s ''[[Marjorie Daw (short story)|Marjorie Daw]]'' and [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]]'s ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' are two examples of epistolary [[short stories]].
