'''''Flaming Carrot Comics''''' is a [[surrealist]] [[comic book]] [[ongoing series|series]] by cartoonist [[Bob Burden]]. The title character first appeared in ''Visions'' #1, a magazine published by the Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1979. Flaming Carrot can be seen as a [[parody]] of various aspects of the [[superhero]] genre (though his origin story is much the same as that of [[Don Quixote]]).<ref name="origin" /> Flaming Carrot adventures have been published by [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]], [[Renegade Press]], [[Dark Horse Comics]], and [[Image Comics]], among others. He has guest-starred, and made cameos in, comics published by [[Fantagraphics]], [[Mirage Studios]], [[Atomeka Press]], and others.

The Flaming Carrot is portrayed as a womanizing, hard drinking, two-fisted, mentally unbalanced individual (calling to mind the gritty [[anti-hero]]es of the 1980s), whilst at the same time almost inexorably being on the side of [[The Establishment]], with at least one instance of telling the audience to "avoid between meal snacks and brush after every meal" similar to the very clean cut, all-American comic characters. However, the series contains more depth than a superhero parody.

Most of his dialogue is disjointed, but sometimes thought-provoking in a [[Zen]] [[Koan]] fashion. Odd [[pop culture]] references and random [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequiturs]] abound throughout the stories. Reflections on philosophy, the absence of meaning in modern life, why someone would choose the life of a superhero, and the effects of waking up from a night of heavy drinking with a speaker surgically implanted in one's chest abound.

The Carrot lives in Palookaville, a neighborhood of Iron City (a working-stiff sort of town like [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Ohio]] or [[Pittsburgh]]).

==Publication history==
The Flaming Carrot first appeared in ''Visions'' #1, the first in a series of magazines produced as part of the Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1979. Flaming Carrot stories went on to appear in each yearly edition of the magazine through 1987. 

In 1981 Burden self-published (under the company name '''Killian Barracks Press''') ''Flaming Carrot Comics'' #1 (oversize), a one-off special.

A four-page, apocryphal Flaming Carrot history in ''Visions'' #4 (1982) convinced [[Dave Sim]] of [[Aardvark-Vanaheim]] to publish Flaming Carrot as a regular comic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flamingcarrot.com/FlamingCarrotPage/FCbibliography.html |title=Flaming Carrot Bibliography |publisher=Flamingcarrot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> though he first wrote the Carrot into the pages of ''[[Cerebus (comics)|Cerebus]]''.<ref>''Cerebus'' #61–62 (Aardvark-Vanaheim, Apr.–May 1984). The Carrot appeared in ''Cerebus'' again a few years later (Nov. 1987), in ''Cerebus'' #104, "Earnest Nonsense."</ref> The first Aardvark-Vanaheim issue<ref>Burden, Bob. "Road Hogs From Outerspace," ''Flaming Carrot'' #1 (Aardvark-Vanaheim, May 1984).</ref> was published in May 1984; it ran five issues until January 1985. The company published a [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] special in 1984.<ref>''A-V In 3-D'' #1 (Aardvark-Vanaheim, Dec. 1984).</ref>

The series was picked up by [[Renegade Press]] for 12 more issues from March 1985 - July 1987. During this time, the Flaming Carrot appeared in the first issue of the [[Fantagraphics]] anthology ''[[Anything Goes! (comics)|Anything Goes!]]'' in October 1986. 

In 1988, Burden began a relationship with [[Dark Horse Comics]] that lasted for 14 years. From June 1988 - October 1994, Dark Horse published 14 more issues of the ongoing ''Flaming Carrot'' series, ending with issue #31. (It also published Carrot stories in its anthology ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'',<ref>''Dark Horse Presents'' #20 (Dark Horse Comics, Aug. 1988).</ref> and the annual anthology ''San Diego Comic Con Comics'' #1.)

In the winter of 1994, Dark Horse published ''Flaming Carrot Stories No. 1'', referred to on the cover as a "Text Version of Future Issue", although a standard pictorial comic version of the story has yet to appear. From 1997-1998, the company published four volumes of the ''Flaming Carrot Comics Collected Album'', which was the first time series had been reprinted, and the 64-page "Flaming Carrot Comics Annual No.1" featuring a new story. In 1999 Dark Horse Comics published 4 issues of the spin-off series "Bob Burden's Original Mysterymen Comics", although it did not feature The Flaming Carrot.  In 2002, Dark Horse published the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] special ''Flaming Carrot & [[Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman]]'' (listed as Flaming Carrot Comics #32 in the indicia).

During this period, in 1989–1990, the British publisher [[Atomeka Press|Atomeka]] printed Flaming Carrot stories in their anthology ''[[A1 (comics)|A1]]'', issues #1–2. In 1993–1994, [[Mirage Studios]] published the four-issue series ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]/ Flaming Carrot Crossover''.

''Flaming Carrot'' was relaunched in 2004 with [[Image Comics]] and [[Desperado Publishing]] with a dual numbering system for four issues.  A ''Photo Comic Special #1'' (issue #37 in the regular series) was published in March 2006, featuring digitally edited photographs instead of artwork.

At times, entire Flaming Carrot storylines would simply be abandoned<ref>Burden, Bob. "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," ''Flaming Carrot'' #24 (Dark Horse Comics, April 1990).</ref>, and numerous projects and spin-offs promised in the series various letter pages and "Bob Speaks" columns never came to fruition.<ref>Burden, Bob. "Bob Speaks," ''Flaming Carrot'' #22 (Dark Horse Comics, June 1989).</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
The Flaming Carrot origin states that "having read 5,000 comics in a single sitting to win a bet, this poor man suffered brain damage and appeared directly thereafter as — the Flaming Carrot!"<ref name="origin">Burden, Bob. "When the Shoes Aren't Worth the Shine," ''Flaming Carrot'' #7 (May 1985).</ref>

To date, Flaming Carrot has staved off at least three [[alien invasion]]s, a [[Communist]] take over of Iron City, flying dead dogs, the [[Man in the Moon]], [[Death (personification)|Death]] itself, and a cloned horde of evil marching [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s boots. Possessing no real super powers, the Carrot wins the day through sheer grit, raw determination, blinding stupidity, and bizarre luck.

Flaming Carrot was also a founding member of a [[blue collar]] superhero group called The [[Mystery Men]], introduced in a flashback/dream sequence in Flaming Carrot Comics #16. The story of this group was later made into a movie,<ref>{{IMDb title|0132347|Mystery Men}}</ref> and a short-lived spin-off comic book series. Flaming Carrot himself does not appear in the film, although a handful of characters like Mr. Furious, the Shoveler, and Dr. Heller do.

== Powers and abilities ==
The Carrot wears a costume that consists of a giant carrot mask (which extends from above his head to below his crotch and is actually on fire at the top), a white shirt, red pants, and flippers on his feet (in case he has to swim). The mask has a continually burning flame at the top and a secret compartment containing a [[nuclear powered]] [[pogo stick]]. (The mask and the pogo stick were invented by Dr. Heller of the [[Mystery Men]].)<ref>[http://www.flamingcarrot.com/FC/secrets.html "Secrets of the Carrot!"] Flaming Carrot official website. Accessed June 7, 2011.</ref> Flaming Carrot also wears a crime fighting [[utility belt]], but unlike that of the [[Batman]], his is filled with [[Silly Putty]], [[rubber band]]s, random [[playing cards]], [[sneezing powder]], and other similarly useless items (which nonetheless can become lethal weapons in his hands). The Flaming Carrot also relies heavily on his 9mm Radom pistol to kill his enemies without hesitation.

Flaming Carrot is able to go into a self-induced state of "Zen stupidity" in order to face danger and evil boldly and without trepidation. <ref>Burden, Bob. "Bob Speaks!," ''Flaming Carrot'' #33 (Images/Desperado, December 2004).</ref>
