'''Al Columbia''' (born 1970) is an [[United States|American]] [[cartoonist]], [[illustrator]], [[writer]], [[photographer]], [[musician]], and [[Film director|filmmaker]].

==Career==
===''Big Numbers'' controversy===
{{main|Big Numbers (comics)}}
At the age of 19 Columbia was hired to work as an assistant to [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] on [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Big Numbers (comics)|Big Numbers]]'' series. When Sienkiewicz withdrew from the project in 1990 after completing the first two issues, Moore and his backers at [[Tundra Publishing]] asked the young Columbia to become the series' sole artist. In 1992 Columbia himself left the project under a cloud of rumors and accusations, including claims that he received payment for work that he never delivered and that he destroyed his own unpublished artwork for the fourth issue of the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blather.net/articles/amoore/big-numbers.html|title=The Alan Moore Interview: Malcolm McLaren and Big Numbers |last=Kavanagh|first=Barry |date=17 October 2000|publisher=Blather.net|accessdate=Dec. 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>Eastman, Kevin.

''Alec: How to Be an Artist'' (Marietta, GA: Top Shelf Productions, 2001), 112-116.</ref> Columbia himself did not address the topic publicly for several years, stating in a 1998 letter to ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' that "I could easily launch into a tirade about the extensive horror of my Tundra experience, but I much prefer the very entertaining and conflicting accounts already in circulation."<ref>Columbia, Al. Letter to the editor. "Kevin Eastman Is a Big, Fat, Fucking Liar!", ''The Comics Journal'' #205, June 1998, 5.</ref> In 2000 he posted a semi-facetious "definitive statement"  on the subject to ''The Comics Journal'''s online [[message board]] (reprinted here <ref>http://www.alanmooresenhordocaos.hpg.ig.com.br/artigos112.htm</ref>), confirming that he destroyed his artwork for the series but disputing other aspects of the published accounts of the fiasco. He elaborated on this statement in a 2004 article published in ''[[The Comics Interpreter]]'' detailing the personal and professional turmoil surrounding the project.<ref>Young, Robert. "Zero Sum Masterpiece: The Division of ''Big Numbers'' (AKA Searching for Al Columbia)", ''The Comics Interpreter'' Vol. 2 #3, 2004, 8-18.</ref>

===1990s===
Columbia's first solo comic book, ''[[Doghead (comic book)|Doghead]]'', was released by Tundra Publishing in 1992. He contributed to three issues of the [[horror comics|horror]] anthology ''From Beyonde''<ref>http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=42&view=topic&forumid=55&postid=52817</ref> in the early nineties, initially under the [[pen name]] "Lucien" and then under his own name. His stories "The Biologic Show" and "Tar Frogs" also appeared in the British magazine ''[[Deadline magazine|Deadline]]''. In these works, which focused on visceral and disturbing subject matter including [[mutilation]], [[incest]], and the [[occult]], he moved away from the painterly [[photorealism]] of his time with Sienkiewicz towards a scabrous but virtuosic pen-and-ink style that emphasized [[grotesque]] [[physiognomic]] details such as grinning mouths full of teeth and leering, reptilian eyes.<ref>http://lambiek.net/artists/c/columbia_al.htm</ref>

In 1994 [[Fantagraphics Books]] published Columbia's comic ''[[The Biologic Show]]'' #0. It contained redrawn versions of his stories from ''Deadline'' along with new works. It received mostly enthusiastic reviews and accolades from other cartoonists including [[Mike Allred]] and [[Jim Woodring]]. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  ''The Biologic Show'' #1 followed in 1995, featuring the first installment of a never-completed [[graphic novel]], ''Peloria''; an issue #2 was advertised but never appeared. Also in 1995, "[[I Was Killing When Killing Wasn't Cool]]" became the first of a series of two-color short stories by Columbia to appear in the Fantagraphics anthology ''[[Zero Zero (comics)|Zero Zero]]''. In these works, noted<ref>Pryor, Marshall. "Young Cartoonist Profiles: Al Columbia", ''The Comics Journal'' #205, June 1998, 80.</ref><ref>[http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/commentary/226/ "CR's Halloween Special: Brief Notes on Horror Comics, Art Comics, and Their Intersection".] ''The Comics Reporter''. Retrieved October 13, 2007.</ref> for their striking visual rhythms and their vivid atmosphere of dread, he adopted a more streamlined drawing style evocative of early [[animated cartoon]]s, particularly the works of [[Fleischer Studios]]. In later stories such as "[[Amnesia (comics)|Amnesia]]" and "Alfred the Great" Columbia combined [[cel animation]]-influenced drawings of characters with minutely detailed [[chiaroscuro]] backgrounds and some use of [[digital illustration]] techniques and [[photo manipulation]]. "[[The Trumpets They Play!]]", a widely praised <ref>http://www.fantagraphics.com/blog/labels/Al%20Columbia.html</ref><ref>http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxviii/1999.12.03/ae/p11design.html</ref><ref>http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/commentary/1148/</ref><ref>http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/045_columbia/045_columbia.htm</ref> work in this style based on the [[Book of Revelation]], appeared in ''[[BLAB!]]'' #10 in 1998. 

During the 1990s Columbia did ancillary tasks such as [[color separation]] for the publications of other cartoonists including [[Chris Ware]] and [[Archer Prewitt]]. He also created artwork for the [[set design]] of comedian [[David Cross]]'s 1999 television special ''The Pride is Back''. Although he gave short [[interview]]s to several [[zine]]s including ''Velour''<ref>"A chat with ol' Al Columbia", interview by Ian Lynam, ''Velour'' #1 (Berkeley, CA: Migraine, n.d.).</ref> and ''Ain't Nothin' Like Fuckin' Moonshine''<ref>''Ain't Nothin' Like Fuckin' Moonshine'' #10 (Portland, OR: Bwana Spoons)</ref> during this period, the small quantity of his published output and the cancellation of several previously announced titles and anthology contributions, compounded with lingering questions about the fate of ''Big Numbers'', made him an object of much speculation. "Whatever happened to Al Columbia?" became a perennial question on comics websites and message boards.<ref>http://www.tfaw.com/blog/2009/09/08/pim-francie-answers-whatever-happened-to-al-columbia/</ref><ref>http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/whatever_happened_to_al_columbia/</ref>

===2000s===
On November 19, 2001 ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran one of Columbia's illustrations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/19/opinion/l-as-the-taliban-flee-time-to-send-in-fido-237108.html | work=The New York Times | title=As the Taliban Flee, Time to Send In Fido | date=November 19, 2001}}</ref> In 2003 he wrote two issues of ''The Pogostick'', an unfinished comic book series illustrated by Ethan Persoff that was nominated for a [[Harvey Award]].<ref>http://www.harveyawards.org/awards_2004nom.html</ref> He created the artwork for [[The Postal Service]]'s 2003 album ''[[Give Up]]''.<ref>http://ogami.subpop.com/bands/postalservice/album.php</ref>

After a three-year delay, Columbia's personal website alcolumbia.com went online in late 2006. The [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based site featured a changing assortment of illustrations, photographs, music videos, and other multimedia content. The site had closed by early 2012.

Columbia's comics and illustrations have been featured in anthologies including ''[[Mome (comics)|Mome]]'', ''[[The Best American Comics]]'', and [[Ashley Wood]]'s ''Swallow'' series. His work has also appeared in the [[Seattle]] newspaper ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'' and in magazines such as ''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'' and ''[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur]]''.

''[[Pim & Francie: The Golden Bear Days]]'', a book collection of previously unpublished work, was released in November 2009 to widespread acclaim.

==Recurring characters==
From ''The Biologic Show'' onwards Columbia's comics have featured a number of recurring characters. Like other traditional cartoon characters, some of them have continued to appear after being killed multiple times.

===Seymour Sunshine===
The most frequent protagonist in Columbia's early work, Seymour Sunshine is a passive [[nebbish]] menaced by bizarre threats. He first appeared in the story "No Tomorrow If I Must Return" in ''The Biologic Show'' #0. In most of his stories, including "I Was Killing When Killing Wasn't Cool" and "The Trumpets They Play!", Seymour is portrayed as being nearly mute, although in "Amnesia" he is more voluble.

===Pim and Francie===
A pair of mischievous [[waif]]s whose antics get them into horrific trouble, Pim and Francie first appeared in the story "Tar Frogs" and are the protagonists in "Peloria Part One" and ''Pim & Francie: The Golden Bear Days''. The two have a loosely-defined [[sibling]] relationship. According to Columbia, they originated as an attempt to draw himself and his former girlfriend as cartoon characters.<ref>http://thedailycrosshatch.com/2009/12/07/interview-al-columbia-pt-2-of-4/</ref>

===Knishkebibble the Monkey-Boy===
Described in the story "Amnesia" as a "childish icon for mischievous and filthy pleasures," Knishkebibble was first introduced in "Peloria Part One". In later appearances he acted as Seymour Sunshine's [[sidekick]], serving mostly to drag both of them into dangerous situations. He is portrayed as greedy, conniving, and vulgar, and usually speaks with a [[hillbilly]] accent.

===Ruthie and Lucy===
A pair of malevolent [[conjoined twins]] who appear as antagonists in several of Columbia's works, including "The Biologic Show", "Peloria Part 1", and ''Pim & Francie: The Golden Bear Days''. They were first identified by name in the story "[[The Blood-Clot Boy]]".

===Alfred the Great===
Alfred the Great is a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] with an enormous [[prehensile]] [[tongue]]. In his eponymous story he rises to fame and fortune as a [[circus sideshow]] performer before his decadent lifestyle and bad temper precipitate a fall from grace. Alfred also appears on the cover of ''Dirty Stories 3''.

===Cheapy the Guinea Pig===
Cheapy the Guinea Pig is an [[experimental subject]] who is used by genetic researchers in a variety of pointlessly cruel tests, such as one intended "to determine the length of time Cheapy can endure being struck repeatedly about the head and face with a ball-peen hammer before he expires."

An [[animated cartoon]] character named Cheapy The Guinea Pig is mentioned in [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s 1932 [[Russian language]] novel ''Kamera Obskura'', in a passage that was deleted from ''[[Laughter in the Dark (novel)|Laughter in the Dark]]'', Nabokov's 1938 [[English language]] translation/adaptation of that book. Introducing his own Cheapy the Guinea Pig in the story "Vladimir Nabokov's Cheapy the Guinea Pig", Columbia described the character's origin in Nabokov's work, and emphasized that his Cheapy was "inspired by the [Nabokov character's] name alone and the many uses that a Guinea pig has to offer to the world of cartoons."

==Music and film==
Columbia was a founding member of The Action Suits, whose other members have included fellow cartoonists [[Peter Bagge]] and Eric Reynolds.<ref>http://www.comicartcollective.com/detail.cfm?page=41FA95A0-A39C-4D7D-AAF86C174319556F</ref> His more recent musical activities, including songs and [[music video]]s recorded with his partner under the name The Francies, have been sporadically documented on his website.

In 2009 he [[Film director|directed]] and appeared in the music video for the song "These Wounds Never Heal" by the American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Unholy (American band)|Unholy]].

==Influence==
[[Gerard Way]], the lead singer of the band [[My Chemical Romance]] and author of the comic book series ''[[The Umbrella Academy]]'', described his exposure to Columbia's work as "a turning point" in his aesthetic development.<ref>http://www.mychemicalfreak.com/2008/07/14/gerard-way-interview-with-igncom/</ref><ref>http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/692850/Fresh-Ink-Online-With-Gerard-Way.html</ref> [[Tunde Adebimpe]] of [[TV on the Radio]] has also cited Columbia as an inspiration.<ref>http://www.straight.com/article-76788/tv-on-the-radio-revels-in-the-moment</ref>

In a 2009 interview with ''[[Juxtapoz]]'' magazine, professional illustrator [[Aaron Horkey]] asserted that "countless successful artists continue to pillage [Columbia's] back catalog, propping up their half-baked careers on the well-worn spines of second hand copies of ''Biologic Show''."<ref>http://www.juxtapoz.com/auction/2009/09/aaron-horkey/</ref>
