'''HMS ''Apollo''''', the fifth ship of the [[Royal Navy]] to be named for the Greek god [[Apollo]], was a [[fifth-rate]] [[Sailing frigate|frigate]] of the [[Lively class frigate|''Lively'' class]], carrying 38 guns, launched in 1805 and broken up in 1856.<ref name=Winfield>Winfield (2008), p.171.</ref>

==Napoleonic Wars==
''Apollo'' was commissioned in July 1805 under Captain Edward Fellowes, who sailed her for the Mediterranean on 26 January 1806.<ref name=Winfield/> In 1806 she operated off southern Italy. On 5 June boats from ''Apollo'' brought out a French brig near Agie Finucana, in the Gulf of Taranto, where she had run aground. The brig was transporting six 24-pounder guns, together with their carriages. The cutting out party had to work through the night under small-arms fire from the shore, as well as fire from a field piece. Still, they managed to retrieve the vessel while suffering only one man wounded. The guns were intended for a new battery opposite the lighthouse.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=934|issue=15940|date=24 December 1805}}</ref>

On 6 July Captain Fellowes was at the [[Battle of Maida]], having been ordered to join the troops by Rear-Admiral Sir [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sidney Smith]] to act as liaison with the Navy should the Army have had to retire. General James Stuart remarked in his account of the battle that Fellowes had been helpful in every way.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1149|endpage=1151|issue=15951|date=5 September 1806}}</ref>

In October ''Apollo'' came under the command of Captain Alexander Schomberg.<ref name=Winfield/> In 1807 she took part in the [[Alexandria expedition of 1807]] in the squadron under the command of Admiral [[Benjamin Hallowell Carew|Benjamin Hallowell]]. However, she and the 19 transports (out of 33) that she was escorting got separated from the rest of the expedition and arrived at [[Abu Qir]] Bay too late to participate meaningfully.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=614|endpage=617|issue=16027|date=9 May 180}}</ref> Seven-and-a-half years later, in October 1814, ''Apollo'', [[French ship Tigre (1793)|Tigre]] and {{HMS|Wizard|1805|2}} would share in prize money for the capture of the Turkish frigates ''Houri Bahar'' and ''Houri Nasaret'', and the corvette ''Feragh Nouma'' as well as the stores captured on 20 March.{{#tag:ref|A captain's share was [[£sd|£]]138 16[[shilling|s]] 3[[pence|d]]; a seaman's share was 9s 8½d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=21936|issue=16953|date=18 October 1814}}</ref>|group=Note}}

In 1808, Captain Bridges Taylor took command of ''Apollo''. Under Taylor, she raided French convoys in the western Mediterranean.  

On 3 June 1808, Rear Admiral Thornbrough sent Sir Francis Laforey in ''Apollo'' to negotiate with the Supreme Junta of the Balearic Isles. the citizens of Mallorca had declared their allegiance to Ferdinand II and wished to begin talks with the British.<ref>Marshall (1827) Supplement, Part 1, pp.86-93.</ref> At the end of the year ''Apollo'' returned to Britain.

Between 30 and 31 October 1809 boats from ''Apollo'' participated in the attack by Hallowell's squadron on vessels of a French convoy that had taken refuge in the Bay of [[Roses, Girona|Rosas]] where they hoped that an armed storeship of 18 guns, two bombards and a [[xebec]] would provide them protection. On 30 October [[HMS Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']], [[HMS Cumberland (1807)|''Cumberland'']], [[French frigate Volontaire (1796)|''Volontaire'']], [[HMS Apollo|''Apollo'']], [[HMS Topaze (1793)|''Topaz'']], [[HMS Philomel (1806)|''Philomel'']], [[HMS Tuscan (1808)|''Tuscan'']] and {{HMS|Scout|1804|2}} sent in their boats. By the following morning the British had accounted for all eleven vessels in the bay, burning those they did not bring out. However, British losses were considerable, numbering 15 killed and 44 wounded overall, with ''Apollo'' alone suffering three dead and five wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=1901|endpage=1904|issue=16319|date=29 November 1809}}</ref> The French vessels captured were the warships ''Grondire'' and ''Normande'', and the transports ''Dragon'' and ''Indien''. The boats also destroyed the ''Lemproye'' and ''Victoire''.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=280|issue=16701|date=9 February 1813}}</ref> A court declared {{HMS|Invincible|1808|2}} a joint captor.{{#tag:ref|Head money was paid for the ''Grondire'' and ''Normande'' and for the destruction of ''Lemproye'' and ''Victoire''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue =16698|date=26 January 1813|startpage=208}}</ref>|group=Note}} 

In 1811 ''Apollo'' returned to the Mediterranean, fighting a large number of small-scale actions and raiding various French-held islands. 

On 13 February 1812, ''Apollo'' took the French frigate ''Merinos'' while operating off [[Cape Corsica]]. ''Merinos'' was a relatively new frigate-built storeship of 850 tons, pierced for 36 guns but carrying only 20 eight-pounders. She had a crew of 126 men under the command of ''Captain de fregate'' Honoré Coardonan, holder of the Legion d'Honour. She was on her way to [[Sagone]] for timber. The French lost six killed and 20 wounded; the British, despite also coming under fire from the shore, suffered no casualties. A French [[corvette]], the ex-[[HMS Mohawk (1798)|HMS ''Mohawk'']], accompanying ''Merinos'', did not come to her aid and escaped. ''Mohawk'' had been captured in 1799, and had a crew of about 130 men, plus some conscripts.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=756|endpage=757|issue=16596|date=21 April 1812}}</ref> 

On 24 April 1812 ''Apollo'', {{HMS|Eagle|1804|2}} and {{HMS|Havannah|1811|2}} landed Lieutenant-colonel George Duncan Robertson, his staff and a garrison at Port St. George on [[Vis (island)|Lissa]].<ref>Pocock (1977), p.184.</ref> The British had defeated a French naval force on 13 March at the [[Battle of Lissa (1811)|Battle of Lissa]] and wanted to establish a base there with Robertson as its first Governor.

On 17 September ''Apollo'' captured the 6-gun privateer [[xebec]] ''Ulysse''. She had a crew of 56 men under the command of Monsieur Oletta, commander of a division of gun-boats at Corfu.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=2472|issue=16679|date=8 December 1812}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The first-class share of the prize money was £60 12s 1d; a sixth-class share was 7s 4½d.<ref>{{London Gazette|startpage=854|issue=17134|date=20 April 18162}}</ref>|group=Note}}

On 21 December ''Apollo'' was in company with the brig-sloop {{HMS|Weazel|1805|2}} when the two vessels chased a [[trabaccolo]] under the protection of the tower of San Cataldo, the strongest such on the coast between [[Brindisi]] and [[Otranto]].<ref name=LG16739/> The tower was armed with three guns and three [[swivel gun]]s. A landing party from the two vessels captured the tower and blew it up.<ref name=LG16739>{{London Gazette|issue=16739|startpage=1122|endpage=1123|date=8 June 1813}}</ref> 

Between 18 January and 3 February 1813, ''Apollo'', together with the privateer ''Esperanza'' and four gunboats, and some 300 troops under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel G. D. Robertson, captured [[Lastovo|Augusta]] and [[Korčula|Carzola]] Islands. At Augusta, a party of seamen from ''Apollo'' spiked the guns of one battery.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16736|startpage=1093|endpage=1094|date=5 June 1813}}</ref> On 1 February Taylor sailed ''Apollo'', the brig {{HMS|Imogene|1805|2}}, under the command of Lieutenant Charles Taylor, and Gunboat ''No. 43'', under the command of Mr. Antonio Pardo, to Carzola. There Captain Taylor commanded a landing party that silenced several sea batteries. When the town capitulated the British captured a privateer that had "molested the trade of the Adriatic", and two of her prizes. That day the British also captured seven vessels in the Channel, sailing to Ragusa and Cattaro, principally with grain, which was in short supply there. The action at Carzola cost ''Apollo'' two men dead, one of whom drowned, and one man wounded.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16749|startpage=1307|endpage=1308|date=3 July 1813}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money was worth £38 18s 8d; a sixth-class share was worth 5s 3d.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17820|startpage=872|date=25 May 1822}}</ref>|group=Note}}

On 19 March, boats from ''Apollo'' and {{HMS|Cerberus|1794|2}} destroyed several vessels, a battery and a tower three miles northwest of the port of [[Monopoli]] near [[Bari]].<ref name=LG16758/> Then on 11 April, ''Apollo'' and ''Cerberus'' took Devil's Island, near the north entrance to Corfu, and thereby captured a brig and a trabaccolo bringing in grain.<ref name=LG16758/> On 14 April the boats chased a vessel into Merlera. They then suffered three men wounded before ''Apollo'' arrived and captured the island. The British found eight vessels with flour and grain that the enemy had scuttled.<ref name=LG16758/> Ten days later,  ''Apollo{{'}}''s boats chased a [[felucca]] into St Cataldo that had troops aboard. A landing party of marines killed one Frenchman, wounded another, and captured 26. (The rest of the troops and the crew of the felucca fled.) ''Apollo{{'}}''s boats brought out the felucca.<ref name=LG16758>{{London Gazette|issue=16758|startpage=1486|date=27 July 1813}}</ref> 

On 17 May boats from ''Apollo'' and ''Cerberus'' took a vessel that ran aground near [[Brindisi]]. She was armed with a 9-pounder gun in the bow and a swivel gun. She was sailing from Otranto to Ancona.<ref name=LG16772/> The next day the boats also brought off a gun from a [[Martello tower]] a little further to the south.<ref name=LG16772/> Then ten days later the boats captured three gunboats at [[Fano]] that were protecting a convoy. The gun-boats each mounted a 9-pounder in their bows and two 4-pounders abaft. They were under the command of an Ufficiale di Vascello, carrying troops for Corfu. The British also captured four vessels from the convoy. British losses amounted to two men killed and one wounded.<ref name=LG16772>{{London Gazette|issue=16772|startpage=1794|endpage=1795|date=11 September 1813}}</ref> 

On 15 June Taylor positioned ''Apollo{{'}}''s boats to intercept four vessels heading into Corfu. They drove one ashore, but then had to turn their attention to a French gunboat that appeared, which they captured. She mounted both a 12 and a 6-pounder gun. In the engagement the French suffered nine men wounded, was the commander and a captain of engineers, Monsieur Baudrand. The gunboat also carried the colonel and chief of engineers of Corfu, (reportedly men of great ability), who were returning after having been to Parga and Pado to improve the fortifications there. {{HMS|Laurel|1813|2}} was in company and took the captured gunboat to St. Maura while ''Apollo'' landed the wounded at Corfu. This caused a delay during which ''Apollo{{'}}''s boats remained near Morto, in Albania. At daylight the following morning six gun-boats, a felucca, and smaller row-boat, all full of troops attacked the boats. Lieutenant W. H. Nares, who had been in charge of the boats in all the above actions, ran them ashore near Parga. From the shore he and his men used their small arms to repel four attacks, during which ''Apollo{{'}}''s boats were destroyed. However, the British lost only one man, who was taken prisoner.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16772|startpage=1795|endpage=1796|date=11 September 1813}}</ref> 

On 6 February 1814, ''Apollo'' and ''Havannah'' were at anchor outside of Brindisi while the French frigate ''Uranie'' was inside the port, on fire. ''Cerberus'' had chased her into the port some weeks earlier while awaiting the action of the officials of the port, which belonged to the Kingdom of Naples, to the presence of the French vessel. When ''Apollo'' appeared on the scene and made signs of being about to enter the port, ''Uranie{{'}}''s captain removed the powder from his ship and set her on fire.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16876|startpage=700|date=2 April 1814}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the head money for the destruction of the ''Uranie'' was worth £159 9s 7¾d; a sixth-class share was worth £1 0s 8½d.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17389|startpage=1478|date=18 August 1818}}</ref>|group=Note}}

On 13 Feb 1814, the island of [[Paxos]], in the Adriatic, surrendered to ''Apollo'' and a detachment of 160 troops. The troops moved so rapidly through the island that the enemy did not have time to organize resistance. As a result, the British force, which included ''inter alia'' men from the 2nd Greek Light Infantry from Cephalonia, from the [[Royal Corsican Rangers]], the [[35th (Royal Sussex) Regiment of Foot|35th Regiment of Foot]], and marines and seamen from the ''Apollo'', captured 122 enemy troops as well as a small, well-designed fort of three guns.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16887|startpage=834|date=19 April 1814}}</ref>

Captain Taylor drowned in early 1814,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16888|startpage=857|date=23 April 1814}}</ref> when his gig capsized as he was returning to ''Apollo'' from a reconnaissance at [[Brindisi]].{{#tag:ref|The crew of the gig drowned with him. An obituary remarks that his loss to drowning was surprising in that on three previous occasions he had himself saved crew men from drowning (presumably by swimming).<ref>''United service magazine'' (1839), p.242.</ref>|group=Note}} On 24 April ''Apollo'' was among the vessels at the capture of the fortress and town of [[Savona]].{{#tag:ref|A first-class share of the prize money was worth £71 10s 6½d; a sixth-class share was worth 9s 5½d.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=17322|startpage=109|date=13 January 1818}}</ref>|group=Note}}

After Taylor's death, ''Apollo'' had several commanders in short order. E.L. Graham took command in June, and was followed by A.B. Valpy (acting), in August. Then W. Hamilton followed him.<ref name="NMM-WH-380026">

''Apollo'' then returned to England where she was placed in [[reserve fleet|ordinary]] at Portsmouth the following year.<ref name=Winfield/>

==Post-war career==

After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ''Apollo'' served as a troopship for many years, including during the [[First Opium War]]. From February 1828 to 1838 she was under the command of Alexander Karley. Then in November 1841 C. Frederick took command.<ref name="NMM-WH-380026"/>

In December 1837 she was fitted at Portsmouth, for £11,402, as a troopship. At this time her armament was reduced. In March 1840 she carried the main body of the [[56th (West Essex) Regiment of Foot]] to Canada where they reinforced the garrison there during the [[Northeastern Boundary Dispute]].<ref>Cannon (1844), p.51.</ref> Then in November 1841 C. Frederick took command and sailed her to the Far East where she participated in the Yangtze operation in July 1842. By March 1845 ''Apollo'' was back at Portsmouth and under the command of W. Raddiff.<ref name="NMM-WH-380026"/>

==Fate==
In June 1856, the 1st Battalion, The [[Rifle Brigade]] embarked on ''Apollo'' at [[Battle of Balaclava|Balaclava]] at the end of the [[Crimean War]] for their return to England. She was broken up at Portsmouth on 16 October 1856.<ref name=Winfield/>
