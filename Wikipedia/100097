==Blur==
{{Main|Blur (band)|l1=Blur}}
[[Image:Blur Newcastle 2009 Coxon Albarn.jpg|200x200px|thumb|Albarn in 2009]]
Blur is an English alternative rock band. Formed in London in 1989 as Seymour, the group consists of singer Damon Albarn, guitarist [[Graham Coxon]], bassist [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]] and drummer [[Dave Rowntree]]. Blur's debut album ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' (1991) incorporated the sounds of [[Madchester]] and [[shoegazing]]. Following a stylistic change—influenced by English guitar pop groups such as [[The Kinks]], [[The Beatles]] and [[XTC]]—Blur released the ''[[Modern Life is Rubbish]]'' (1993), ''[[Parklife]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Great Escape (Blur album)|The Great Escape]]'' (1995) albums. As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a famous chart battle with rival band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] dubbed "[[Britpop#Peak of success|The Battle of Britpop]]".

In recording their follow-up, ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'' (1997), the band underwent another reinvention, influenced by the lo-fi style of American indie rock bands such as [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]. "[[Song 2]]", one of the album's singles, brought Blur brief mainstream success in the US. The last album featuring Blur's original line-up, ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' (1999) found the band members experimenting with electronic music and gospel music, as Albarn wrote more personal lyrics. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'' (2003). Containing electronic sounds and more minimal guitar work, the album was marked by Albarn's growing interest in hip hop and African music. After a 2003 tour without Coxon, Blur did no studio work or touring as a band, as members engaged in other projects. Subsequently, Blur reunited in 2009 with Coxon back in the fold. Following a series of successful concerts, Blur left the spotlight until they released their first single in a decade by the original line-up, called "[[Fool's Day]]". On 21 February 2012, Blur were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the Brits. They went on to perform 5 tracks: 'Boys and Girls', 'Song 2', 'Parklife', 'Tender' and 'This is a Low'. Blur will headline at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], with [[New Order]] and [[The Specials]], to celebrate the closing of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] on 12 August 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17110538|title=London 2012: Blur to headline Olympics closing show|date=21 February 2012|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref>

===''The Good, the Bad and the Queen''===
{{main|The Good, the Bad and the Queen}}
[[Image:The Good the Bad and the Queen mg 6673.jpg|thumb|Albarn in 2007]]
In May 2006, NME reported that Albarn was working with [[Danger Mouse]] on his first solo album, tentatively titled ''The Good, the Bad and the Queen''. However, in July 2006, [[NME Music]] reported that those plans had been switched to the formation of a new band titled The Good, the Bad and the Queen. This proved to be inaccurate, as Albarn and other members of the group have indicated that ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Queen]]'' is the name of the album and not the band itself.<ref name="Daily Record">{{cite web|title=It's all a bit of a blur for Damon|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=5 February 2007|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/therazz/daily/tm_method=full%26objectid=18569699%26siteid=66633-name_page.html}}</ref><ref name="The Courier Mail">{{cite news|title=Good, Bad and super|date=3 February 2007|accessdate=5 February 2007|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,21126426-5003421,00.html | work=The Sunday Mail (Qld) | first=Lucy | last=Carne}}</ref><ref name="Time out">{{cite web|title=The band with no name|date=31 January 2007

The group's line-up is composed of Albarn, former [[The Clash|Clash]] bassist [[Paul Simonon]], [[The Verve]]/Gorillaz guitarist [[Simon Tong]], and drummer [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]] of [[Fela Kuti]]'s band, [[The Africa '70]]. [[Danger Mouse]] produced the album and decided on the final track listing.

The first single by the line-up, "[[Herculean (song)|Herculean]]", was released in late October 2006, and peaked at #22 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. A second single, "[[Kingdom of Doom]]", and the band's debut album were then released in January 2007. That single fared slightly better than "Herculean", peaking at #20, while the album peaked at #2 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and went [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] during its first week of release in the UK. "[[Green Fields]]" was released as the third single from the album in April 2007, just missing out on the Top 50.

On 27 April 2008, ''The Good The Bad And The Queen'' headlined the [[Love Music Hate Racism|Love Music Hate Racism Carnival]] in Victoria Park where they introduced on stage several guests including ex-[[The Specials|Specials]] keyboard player [[Jerry Dammers]]. He also worked with Syrian rapper and friend [[Eslam Jawaad]] on the song "Mr. Whippy", though the song does not appear on the album it is a B-Side on the [[Herculean (song)|Herculean]] single.

===Rocketjuice and The Moon===
{{main|Rocketjuice and The Moon}}
[[Rocketjuice and The Moon]] is the title of Albarn's new side-project featuring [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] and [[afrobeat]] legend [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]]. Albarn said that he is not responsible for the name and that someone in [[Lagos]] did the sleeve design and that’s the name he gave it, which he said he is fine with because trying to find a name for another band is always tricky. The band performed together for the first time on the 28th of October 2011 in Cork, Ireland, as part of the annual Cork Jazz Festival, under the moniker Another Honest Jon's Chop Up!. A full tour is not expected anytime soon due to the Red Hot Chili Peppers tour lasting until 2013. Their debut album will be released on March 12, 2012.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a347880/damon-albarn-flea-to-release-album-as-rocketjuice-and-the-moon.html</ref>

===Other appearances===
Albarn has also appeared on other unrelated works. Albarn was asked, alongside Blur bandmate Graham Coxon, to remix the [[Massive Attack]] song "Angel" for the single release, in 1998. Albarn then adapted the pseudonym of "Control Freak" for his remixing career. He only ever used the name once in a remix, when he remixed the Blur song "[[Bugman (song)|Bugman]]" as Control Freak for the single release of "[[Coffee & TV]]" in summer 1999. [[The Rentals]]' 1999 Album ''[[Seven More Minutes]]'' features Albarn on the track "Big Daddy C". 

Albarn contributed backing vocals to a song on Massive Attack's [[100th Window]], released the following year. More recently, he sang in the track "Saturday Come Slow" from Massive Attack's [[Heligoland (album)|Heligoland]] album.<ref name="NME website">[http://www.nme.com/news/blur/20152 NME website]</ref> Albarn also appeared on the [[Nathan Haines]]' song "Squire for Hire", however Albarn credited it to Gorillaz' frontman [[2D (Gorillaz)|2D]] instead.

Albarn provided the voiceover intro and backing vocals in the song "Time Keeps On Slipping" for the rap [[concept album]] ''[[Deltron 3030]]'', and featured on the track "Lovage (Love That Lovage, Baby)" for the [[Lovage (band)|Lovage]] album ''[[Music to Make Love to Your Old Lady By]]''. Both albums were produced by [[Dan the Automator]], who also produced Gorillaz' debut album. He also produced in 2008 parts of [[Amadou & Mariam]]'s fifth album ''[[Welcome to Mali]]''.

He appeared on the track "Saturday Come Slow"  on the [[Massive Attack]]'s 2010 album ''[[Heligoland (album)|Heligoland]].

==Acting career==
Albarn starred in Antonia Bird's 1997 film ''[[Face (1997 film)|Face]]'' alongside Ray Winstone and Robert Carlisle. Albarn was also featured in Gunar Karlsson's 2007 film ''[[Anna and the Moods]]''. Albarn also played Bull in Joe Orton's "Up Against It", a Radio 4 play about The Beatles broadcast in 1998.

==Personal life==
Albarn had a long-standing relationship with [[Elastica]] frontwoman [[Justine Frischmann]].<ref name="Strong" /> His involvement with her profoundly influenced his songwriting in Blur in the mid-to-late 1990s.  In the 1990s he spent a good deal of time in [[Reykjavík]], and owns a home in [[Grafarvogur]], a suburb of Reykjavík. He currently lives in [[Bayswater]], London with artist [[Suzi Winstanley]], and their daughter.

Albarn's grandfather, Edward Albarn, was a conscientious objector during the [[Second World War]] and was involved in a farming community in Lincolnshire. Albarn himself is outspokenly [[anti-war]] and has criticised British involvement in the wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} In 2002, he and [[Robert Del Naja]] of [[Massive Attack]] took out full page advertisements in the NME challenging the need for war.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} 

In 2005 Albarn, among others, criticised the London [[Live 8]] concert for not featuring enough black artists; among the few included were [[Ms. Dynamite]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Youssou N'Dour]]. Eventually the organisers added a separate concert at the Eden Project in Cornwall to the programme in order to showcase African musicians. Albarn said he did not want to perform at Live 8 because he thought it was too "exclusive" and may have been motivated by self-promotion.<ref name="NME website"/>

Albarn has been a vocal critic of celebrity culture:<blockquote>"We need to dismantle very significant parts of our culture and really re-examine them. I suppose you start with the celebrity thing... you have to get rid of things like ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'' immediately."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7161966.stm|title=Albarn condemns celebrity culture|date=27 December 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

Albarn is a vegetarian, and a fan of English football club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].
