{{Japanese name|Kakuta}}

{{nihongo|'''Kakuji Kakuta'''|角田 覚治|Kakuta Kakuji|extra=23 September 1890 &ndash; 2 August 1944}}, was an admiral in the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] during [[World War II]]. He is noted for his role in commanding Japanese [[naval aviation]] units in the [[Pacific War]].

==Biography==
Kakuta was a native of rural [[Minamikanbara District, Niigata|Minamikanbara]], [[Niigata Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. He graduated from the 39th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Academy]], scoring 45th out of a class of 145 cadets in 1911. He served as [[midshipman]] on the [[cruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Aso||2}} and [[battlecruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Ibuki||2}}. On commissioning as [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]], he was assigned to the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Chiyoda||2}}. Later, as a [[lieutenant]], he served on the [[battleship]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Settsu||2}} and the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Azuma||2}} during [[World War I]]. He then served on the battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}, [[destroyer]] {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Yanagi||2}}, and was chief gunner on the cruisers {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Suma||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Tenryū||2}}.

Kakuta was appointed as [[equipment officer]] on the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yubari||2}} in 1923. He then attended the 23rd class of the [[Naval War College (Japan)|Naval Staff College]], and was promoted to [[lieutenant commander]] upon graduation. In 1926, he served as chief gunner on the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Furutaka||2}} and subsequently in a number of staff positions. His first command was the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Kiso||2}}, beginning on 10 March 1934. He subsequently commanded cruisers ''Furutaka'' and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Iwate||2}}, and battleships {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}}. He was promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 15 November 1939.

At the start of the [[Pacific War]] in December 1941, Kakuta was in command of Carrier Division 4, consisting of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Ryūjō||2}}, which provided air support for landings of Japanese forces in the [[Philippines]].<ref name=Klemen>{{cite web|first=Klemen |last=L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/kakuta.html |title=Rear-Admiral Kakaji Kakuta |date=1999-2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref> Kakuta also participated in the [[Indian Ocean Raid]] against British bases in [[India]] and [[Ceylon]] in early 1942.

During the [[Battle of Midway]] in June 1942, Kakuta commanded a task force consisting of carriers ''Ryūjō'' and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Jun'yō||2}} that conducted air raids against [[Battle of Dutch Harbor|Dutch Harbor]] as part of the initial stages of the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign]].<ref name=Klemen/> 

Later, as commander of the [[Second Carrier Division|Second Carrier Striking Force]] that included aircraft units assigned to carriers ''Jun'yō'' and {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}, Kakuta directed aircraft operations against [[United States Navy|U.S. naval forces]] during the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]].

Kakuta was promoted to [[vice admiral]] on 1 November 1942. Following the death of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], the new [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Combined Fleet]], [[Mineichi Koga]], restructured the Imperial Japanese Navy around the American carrier task force concept. On 1 July 1943, Kakuta was assigned command of the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy|First Air Fleet]] which included all land-based naval aircraft units located throughout the [[Philippines]] and Japanese-held islands in the central Pacific. However, the squadrons suffered massive aircraft and personnel losses from American carrier raids in February 1944. Under Kakuta's direction from his headquarters on [[Tinian]], many of the remaining aircraft units participated in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June 1944, but were unable to play a decisive role, suffering further heavy losses.

Kakuta was the senior military officer on the island during the [[Battle of Tinian]] although he was not directly responsible for the defenses. As the Americans closed in on Tinian, Kakuta and his staff made repeated efforts to escape in rubber boats at prearranged rendezvous with a Japanese [[submarine]]. After several failed attempts, Kakuta and his staff withdrew to a cave on the east coast of Tinian and were never seen again. It is presumed that Kakuta committed suicide soon after the Americans landed and that his body was buried in a secret location by members of his staff.<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan'', p. 259.</ref>
