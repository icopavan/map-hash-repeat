==Biography==
Patrick Craven Green was born in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] to Craven Earl Green and Patricia Burgess.  He was raised in [[Waco, Texas]], where he attended [[Vanguard College Preparatory School]] for grades 7-12.  Green's father was a former Air Force officer and stage actor who influenced his son's love of music.  His parents divorced when he was seven. His mother later remarried.

After high school, Green attended [[Texas Tech University]] where he was a member of [[FarmHouse| FarmHouse Fraternity]].<ref>[http://digbatonrouge.com/article/dancehall-dreamer-676/ Dancehall Dreamer Pat Green is all about Texas]</ref>  Green started his music career as an 18 year old at Texas Tech playing small [[gig (musical performance)|gig]]s at bars and clubs around [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]].  In 1995, Green independently recorded and released a series of albums produced by [[Lloyd Maines]] using money borrowed from his parents.<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/green-pat-021226.shtml PopMatters Music Interview | Pat Green: Texas Songwriter<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Green did not commit fully to his music career until 1997 when his stepfather fired him from his job as a fuel wholesaler.  Green had been counting his money from a weekend of singing and his stepfather knew he would need motivation to fully pursue music as a career.<ref name="americanprofile.com">[http://www.americanprofile.com/articles/singer-pat-green/ American Profile - Singer Pat Green]</ref>

After committing to music, Green drew the attention of [[Willie Nelson]] and joined a tour featuring Nelson and several other famous country musicians.  Green's appearance at the 1998 Willie Nelson 4 July Picnic was his first step towards nationwide recognition, and he was soon playing sold out shows in Texas.  Green was sponsored by [[Miller Lite]] and sold more than 250,000 albums, even without signing a major label recording contract.<ref name="americanprofile.com"/>

==Music career==
[[File:Pat-Green-(edited).jpg|thumb|right|225px|Pat Green performing in June 2008]]

Green's first major-label recorded album, ''Three Days'' was released in 2001. "Wave on Wave" was released in 2003, with the title track reaching as high as 3 on the charts. In late 2004 "Lucky Ones" was Green's 3rd and final CD release on the Universal/Republic label. After spending many years playing to young audiences in college towns across America, Green joined popular country music artists including [[Keith Urban]], [[Gretchen Wilson]] and [[Kenny Chesney]] on major tours.<ref name="Tour">[http://www.gactv.com/gac/nw_headlines/article/0,,GAC_26063_5622788,00.html News : Headlines : No Complaints from Pat Green : Great American Country<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Green released his album ''Cannonball'' in 2006. Later that year, he toured with labelmate Kenny Chesney.<ref name="Tour" />  In February 2008, Green released a coffee table book containing photos of dance halls that he had frequented throughout his career entitled "Pat Green's Dance Halls & Dreamers".<ref>[http://www.dancehallsanddreamers.com Pat Green's Dance Halls and Dreamers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The book includes locations such a [[Gruene Hall]], Luckenbach and Floore's Country Store as well as interviews with Texas musicians  Willie Nelson, [[Jack Ingram]], [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]], and [[Robert Earl Keen]].

In 2008, Green released "[[Let Me (Pat Green song)|Let Me]]", as the first single from his album ''[[What I'm For]]''.  The single reached 12 on the country charts, giving Green his first Top 20 single since "Feels Just Like It Should" reached #13 in 2006. Initially, "Country Star" was released as the second single, but it was withdrawn shortly after the title track ("What I'm For") began receiving airplay.  "Country Star" peaked at 32, and "What I'm For" peaked at 28 on the country charts in July 2009.  Green parted ways with [[BNA Records|BNA]] shortly after this.

Green started out releasing "[[Texas country music]]" with songs such as "I Like Texas" and "Southbound 35." His career has taken a significant turn since the release of his major label albums and big act tours. Now striving for more mainstream pop country stardom, Green continued to climb the Nashville charts and build a national fan base as he smoothed out his sound with contemporary country releases. As of 2011, Green has announced his return to [[Texas]] and independent music.<ref>http://www.youtube.com/user/TXmusicTV?v=ioxtMzDpVCU&feature=pyv</ref>

Green is an ardent fan of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].  "I Like Texas," a song from his 1995 self-released album, ''Dancehall Dreamer'', has been adopted as the Rangers' victory song.
