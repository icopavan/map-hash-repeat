'''Lane splitting''' refers to a [[two-wheeled vehicle]] moving between lanes of vehicles that are proceeding in the same direction.  More narrowly, it refers to passing stopped or slower moving traffic between lanes at a speed greater than surrounding traffic.<ref>{{Citation

Lane splitting by motorcycles is generally legal in Europe, and in Japan and several other countries, and is illegal in many [[U.S. state]]s, but is considered lawful in California (see list below).

== Filtering forward ==

'''Filtering forward''', or filtering, is a technique used by bicyclists and motorcyclists to pass a stopped or slow-moving lane of congested traffic by traveling in unused lane space. When the space used is between two lines of vehicles, this is also known as lane splitting, but filtering can be accomplished by using space on the outside edge of same-direction traffic as well. There can be a significant saving of time by bypassing what otherwise would be obstructions.<ref>"Even in congested areas there is nearly always sufficient roadway width available for cyclists to lane share with stopped motorists, so cyclists ''filter'' forward through traffic jams." John Forester, '''Bicycle Transportation''', second edition, p. 73</ref><ref>"In some states, it is legal for a motorcycle to ride between lanes of traffic.  This is known as ''splitting lanes''.  Doing this when traffic is moving at normal speed is, of course, insane."  Darwin Homstrom, '''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Motorcycles''', p 179</ref>

In Australia a furor erupted when the transport authorities decided to consolidate and clarify the disparate set of laws that collectively made lane splitting illegal.  Because of the very opacity of the laws they were attempting to clarify, many Australians had actually believed that lane splitting was legal, and they had been practicing it as long as they had been riding.  They interpreted the action as a move to change the law to make lane splitting illegal.  Because of the volume of public comment opposed to this, the authorities decided to take no further action and so the situation remained as it was.<ref>{{

In excess of 800 submissions (excluding duplicated submissions) were received, which primarily oppose the recommendation. The NTC notes that there is a wide misperception among the motorcycling community that lane-splitting and/or lane-filtering is legal.

Filtering forward, in stopped or extremely slow traffic, requires very slow speed and awareness that in a [[door zone]], vehicle doors may unexpectedly open.  Also, unexpected vehicle movements such as lane changes may occur with little warning. [[Bus]]es and [[tractor trailers]] require extreme care, as the cyclist may be nearly invisible to the drivers who may not expect someone to be filtering forward. To avoid a hook collision with a turning vehicle at an intersection after filtering forward to the intersection, cyclists are taught to either take a position directly in front of the stopped lead vehicle, or stay behind the lead vehicle.  Cyclists should not stop directly at the passenger side of the lead vehicle, that being a [[Blind spot (automobile)|blind spot]].<ref>"Make sure instead that you are either well behind (so that car can't hit you), or well forward of the driver (so the driver can't miss seeing you)."  John Forester, "Effective Cycling", 3rd Edition, p. 313</ref><ref>"Riding between rows of stopped or moving cars in the same lane can leave you vulnerable. A car could turn suddenly or change lanes, a door could open, or a hand could come out of a window."

Here's why: Cars at intersections ahead of you can see you better if you're squarely in the road rather than on the extreme edge where you're easily overlooked. ..."

===Relevant research===
There is no safety research in the United States which has directly examined the question of lane splitting, in spite of the opportunity to compare similar populations of riders in the US who lane split in California but do not (legally) do so elsewhere.  The European [[MAIDS report]] studied the causes of motorcycle accidents in four countries where it is legal and one where it is not, yet reached no conclusion as to whether it contributed to or prevented accidents.<ref name="MAIDS"/>

Proponents of lane splitting state the [[Hurt Report]] of 1981 reached the conclusion that lane splitting improves motorcycle safety by reducing rear end crashes.<ref name="Squatriglia"/>  Lane splitting supporters also state that the [[United States Department of Transportation|US DOT]] [[Fatality Analysis Reporting System|FARS]] database shows that fatalities from rear end collisions into motorcycles are 30% lower in California than in Florida or Texas, states with similar riding seasons and populations but which do not lane split.<ref>{{Citation| url=http://www.whybike.com/blog/index.php?p=147 |work= WhyBike? | title= Is sharing lanes more or less dangerous than sitting in traffic? |date= 27 February 2007 | accessdate= 2007-09-01 }}</ref>  No specifics are given about where this conclusion is found in the FARS system.  The database is available online to the public.<ref>http://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov</ref> The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHSTA]] does say, based on the Hurt Report, that lane splitting "slightly reduces" rear-end accidents, and is worthy of further study due to the possible congestion reduction benefits.<ref name="NHSTA">{{ Citation |title=National agenda for motorcycle safety |author=United States. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Motorcycle Safety Foundation |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  | year=2000 |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/pedbimot/motorcycle/00-NHT-212-motorcycle/motorcycle51.html |quote=There is evidence (Hurt,  1981) that traveling between lanes of stopped or slow-moving cars (i.e., lane splitting) on multiple-lane roads (such as interstate highways) slightly reduces crash frequency compared with staying within the lane and moving with other traffic.   Although lane splitting is allowed in just a few areas of the United States, notably California, it appears to be worthy of further study because it offers a means of reducing congestion in addition to possible safety benefits. It is widely used in many other countries. }}</ref>

Lane splitting is never mentioned anywhere in the Hurt Report, and all of the data was collected in California, so no comparison was made between of lane splitting vs. non-lane splitting.   The Hurt Report ends with a list of [[List of Findings in the Hurt Report|55 specific findings]], such as "Fuel system leaks and spills are present in 62% of the motorcycle accidents in the post-crash phase. This represents an undue hazard for fire."  None of these findings mentions lane splitting, or rear end collisions. The legislative and law enforcement advice that follows this list does not mention lane splitting or suggest laws be changed with regard to lane splitting.

In Europe, the MAIDS Report was conducted using [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) standards in 1999&ndash;2000 and collected data on over 900 motorcycle accidents in five countries, along with non-accident exposure data (control cases) to measure the contribution of different factors to accidents, in the same way as the Hurt Report.  Four of the five countries where data was collected allow lane splitting, while one does not, yet none of the conclusions contained in the MAIDS Final Report note any difference in rear-end accidents or accidents during lane splitting.  It is notable that the pre-crash motion of the motorcycle or scooter was lane-splitting in only 0.4% of cases, in contrast to the more common accident situations such as "Moving in a straight line, constant speed" 49.1% and "Negotiating a bend, constant speed" 12.1%.  The motorcyclist was stopped in traffic prior to 2.8% of the accidents.<ref name="MAIDS">{{Citation |title=MAIDS (Motorcycle Accidents In Depth Study) Final Report 1.2 | date=September 2004 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/roadsafety_library/publications/maids_report_1_2_september_2004.pdf | publisher=ACEM, the European Association of Motorcycle Manufacturers | page=49 | quote=Table 5.7: PTW pre-crash motion prior to precipitating event Stopped in traffic, speed is zero 2.8% &#91;...&#93;  Stripe-riding, filtering forward between lanes, longitudinal motion  0.1%  Filtering forward between lanes, both longitudinal and lateral motion 0.3% }}</ref>

Preliminary results from a study in the United Kingdom, conducted by the [[University of Nottingham]] for the [[Department for Transport]], show that filtering is responsible for around 5% of motorcycle [[Killed or Seriously Injured]] (KSI) accidents.<ref name=DDClarke>{{cite web | url= http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roadsafety/research/behavioural/thirteenthseminar/motorcycleaccidentsprelimina4695?page=4 | title= Motorcycle accidents: preliminary results of an in-depth case-study - Road Safety Research Report No. 54. | year= 2004| publisher= [[Department for Transport]] | first= DD | last= Clarke | coauthors= Ward P, Truman W, Bartle C | accessdate= 28 May 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
It also found that in these KSI cases the motorist is twice as likely to be at fault as the motorcyclist due to motorists "failing to take into account possible motorcycle riding strategies in heavy traffic".<ref name=DDClarke/>

Proponents state that the practice relieves congestion by removing commuters from cars and gets them to use the unused roadway space between the cars.<ref name="Squatriglia"/><ref name="NHSTA"/><ref name="Hough2">{{Citation |last=Hough |first=David L. | author-link=David_L._Hough |title=Proficient Motorcycling: The Ultimate Guide to Riding Well |edition=2nd |year=2000|publisher=BowTie Press|location=USA | url=http://books.google.com/?id=yeAIAIxS-cgC&q |isbn=1889540536, 9781889540535  |page=213 | quote=If you think the practice of motorcyclists squeezing between columns of cars on the freeway is completely stupid, dangerous, and unnecessary, you're not alone.

As congestion gets worse, you are more likely to see lane splitting by local motorcyclists, whether it's legal or not. }}</ref><ref name="Time Saver">{{Citation | last=Kim |first=Ray | title=Lane Splitting:  Time Saver or Insanity? | url=http://www.startriding.com/articles/2006/february/lane_spliltting.htm | archiveurl=http://google.com/search?q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.startriding.com%2Farticles%2F2006%2Ffebruary%2Flane_spliltting.htm | work= | publisher= | archivedate=27 Mar 2009 04:38:22 GMT. | date=February 22, 2006 | accessdate= 2009-04-29 | quote=For:      * It saves time for the rider.    * It's better than sitting in traffic, waiting to get rear-ended.    * If riders are splitting lanes instead of taking a space in traffic, everyone moves faster.

In the US, transportation engineers have suggested that motorcycles are too few, and will remain too few, to justify any special accommodation or legislative consideration, such as lane splitting.  Unless it becomes likely that very large number of Americans will switch to motorcycles, they will offer no measurable congestion relief even with lane splitting. Rather, laws and infrastructure should merely incorporate motorcycles into normal traffic with minimal disruption and risk to riders.<ref name="Sigurd1">{{ Citation |title=Urban Transportation Systems: Choices for Communities |first=Sigurd |last=Grava |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |year=2003 | isbn=0071384170, 9780071384179 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=cGTeYtzIgaUC&pg=PA123 |pages=123–124 |quote=Since it cannot be expected that there will be large volumes of motorcycles or scooters at any time on any segment of the street network in American communities, it is not a matter of attempting to determine throughput capacities, but rather an issue of incorporating these machines into regular motor vehicle volumes without disruption of flow patters or endangering any of the riders.

Another consideration is that lane splitting in the United States, even where legal, can possibly leave the rider legally responsible. In California, it is legal only if done safely: "'Safely' is always very much a judgment call.

When the 2005 bill to legalize lane splitting in Washington State was defeated, a Washington State Patrol spokesman testified in opposition, saying that, "it would be difficult to set and enforce standards for appropriate speeds and conditions for lane splitting.

After discussing the pros and cons at great length, motorcycle safety guru [[David L. Hough]] ultimately argues that a rider, given the choice to legally lane split, is probably safer doing so, than to remain stationary in a traffic jam.   However, Hough has not gone on record as favoring changing the law in jurisdictions where it is not permitted, in contrast to his public education and legislative efforts in favor of rider training courses and helmet use.

A literature review of lane-sharing by the Oregon Department of Transportation notes "a potential safety benefit is increased visibility for the motorcyclist. Splitting lanes allows the motorcyclist to see what the traffic is doing ahead and be able to proactively maneuver." However, the review was limited and "Benefits were often cited in motorcyclist advocacy publications and enthusiast articles." <ref>{{Citation

In California no law explicitly and clearly prohibits lane splitting, and significantly, it has become the traditional policy of law enforcement, the courts, and the public in California to tolerate it when it is done safely.

Other jurisdictions have similar or identical legal codes on the books, yet their authorities have, over time, interpreted the law as prohibiting lane splitting in all cases, even when done safely, and so riders are cited for it.<ref>{{Citation |title=Motorcycle Accidents: Lane Splitting |publisher=Nolo |url=http://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/ObjectID/4D7DF98C-5350-4D04-A0549A3A0F4632D7/catID/C2B5FF79-6DD8-4FD5-85351429C56DCFFD/104/199/255/ART/ |quote=Is Lane Splitting Legal?

One state, California, does specifically permit lane splitting, but only if it is done in a “safe and prudent” manner. Of course, the definition of “safe and prudent” is very much up to interpretation by police officers and judges.
