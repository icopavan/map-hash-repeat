**** Perhaps, but the comment followed mine above at least in time, so that's the context of my response, and I am genuinely puzzled by the comment.

**I think Abu badali is asking the right question&mdash;logos have informative value because they are used by a subject (a company, a band, etc.) to represent it or call it to mind, and can do so with very little content or context because of that subject's repeated self-identification.  Of what value to Wikipedia is a logo that the subject does not actually use?  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 22:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*** Well, the same editor will not allow the actual logo to be used. So if we can't use a logo the band uses, and we can't use a logo the band doesn't use, what's left? [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 22:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

****Whether any image can be used is not really the point now, is it? Of what value to Wikipedia is a logo that the subject does not actually use? That rather makes it a fake logo, doesn't it? In which case I'd think it would be better not to use any graphic, and just use the name of the band in plain text rather than invent something and pretend like it's a real logo. Or am I wrong? [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 22:55, 12 March 2007 (UTC) 
***** There are so many issues here. First, that may very well be the solution chosen, however ''deleting'' the image is completely the wrong way to go about it. This is a decision for the editors of the articles in question, and as far as we can tell this is a free image and therefore can be used. Second, the only reason this is currently used in the template at all is because some editors were edit warring to remove the actual logo as invalid fair use, and I put this image in there so that the edit warring would stop. [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 23:02, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
******Well, first, there was no justification for edit warring &mdash; fair use images are never used in templates.

*******There was a discussion underway. There was no reason to remove this image while it was under discussion, and in fact I asked that it not be removed while the discussion was underway. That rather polite request was not honoured, so I replaced the image with a free image ''for the purposes of the discussion''. And it was still removed. [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 23:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
********Because fair use images haven't been allowed in templates for God knows how long. You make big changes after discussion. You don't make a big change &mdash; i.e., allowing fair use in the template namespace &mdash; and then expect expect others to have to discuss your challenge to long-standing, widely-agreed-upon consensus before reverting back. &mdash; '''[[User:Rebelguys2|Rebelguys2]]''' <sup><font color="#CC5500">[[User talk:Rebelguys2|talk]]</font></sup> 23:16, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

**********Huh? How so? Fair use images shouldn't be used in navigation boxes, though there can be a fair use argument for use elsewhere.

*********** I wanted to discuss a technique in the template which, to me, had the potential of being in compliance with FU#9.

You're entirely welcome to say this is also not in compliance, but I've had great difficulty even explaining how it works without an actual example. So an opportunity presented itself. I did not consider it disruption until the free image itself was put up for IFD and the original uploader was not notified.

*'''Remove from any articles, and maybe totally delete'''. Since it was admittedly made to look like the original logo, that is a trademark violation unless the original owner has a policy that allows it. It might also be a copyright violation; even if you start from scratch and draw something that looks similar, that might be a breach.

**GunnarRene, trademark protection does not work like copyright protection.  It only protects against the use of similar trademarks being used on similar products or services such that consumers may become confused as to who made what.  It does not protect against copying in the abstract, as copyright does.  The user created logo would have to be associated with a competitor of Evanescence, such as another band (just as if a beverage other than Coca-Cola used white script on a red background), or used in a manner that incorrectly suggests that Evanescence created or sponsored this website.  There just isn't a real trademark concern here, and even if there were, copyright licenses such as the GFDL are completely irrelevant to trademarks.  And as I explained above, I don't think there is a copyright concern either.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 00:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
***The EV-In.svg is not a copyrighted logo created by Evanescence or Wind-up Records. It was created by me, and I want to share it. That's why I used the GFDl and cc-by-sa 2.5 tags.

*'''Delete'''.  It's pretty clearly a derivative work of the Evanescence logo.  If the creator can claim fair use of the original logo (possibly on the grounds of parody), they can release their work under a free license, but that's getting into areas of fair-use doctrine I'd ''really'' rather avoid. --[[User:Carnildo|Carnildo]] 04:08, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

::From [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000101----000-.html 17 USC 101]: "A “derivative work” is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted."  Looks to me like [[:Image:EV-In.svg]] took the 'E', 'V', and terminating circle from the Evanescence logo and combined them into a new logo, which makes it a derivative work. --[[User:Carnildo|Carnildo]] 03:39, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
:::But what it takes from the original has to be itself copyrightable for it to be a derivative.  "EV" certainly isn't copyrightable, nor are circles, and the user logo does not even intersect the text with the circle in the same way as the band logo so the composition is different.  If the original band logo is copyrightable, it would probably have to be copied nearly verbatim to be infringed, because it's so simple.  [[User:Postdlf|Postdlf]] 23:09, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

**** I didn't provide any link, so I have no idea what you're talking about. Original uploader tagged it as promophoto, and the image is so identified on the lost-media.com site which you provided above. [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 01:05, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*****OK. The link isn't working. And the source is "a fan run website and is not affiliated with ABC/Touchstone TV in any way." They don't have ownership of these photos, so how do they have the right to say that these are promo photos? If they ''are'' indeed promo photos, provide evidence from the owners of the image. &mdash; '''[[User:Rebelguys2|Rebelguys2]]''' <sup><font color="#CC5500">[[User talk:Rebelguys2|talk]]</font></sup> 04:24, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
* According to original nomination: ''...lost-media.com's copyright notice gives no indication that this is a promotional photograph...'' That's simply false, it clearly is so indicated, as even cursory research would have discovered. If this is now insufficent for a good faith belief that the image was, in fact, an ABC promophoto, fine. [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 12:58, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

:'''Delete''': Fansites are never a valid source for promotional images. They are at best resuers (but usually simply copyright violators). The original source must be know in order to state an image is really promotional. Not every thing that looks like promo material is promo material (in the sense that it's intended to be widely used by the media). Some material, for instance, is only intended to be used on the official website (increasing it's value), or intended to be used only by specific media members according to some exclusivity deal. --''[[User:Abu badali|Abu badali]] <sup>([[User_talk:Abu badali|talk]])</sup>'' 18:46, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
:: The original nominator said nothing about the source of the promophoto being a problem, so this is an entirely different issue. Could it be resolved by using a generic fair use tag and lowering the resolution? [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 23:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
:::No, because it has nothing to do with image resolution. The nominator said "''lost-media.com is "a fan run website and is not affiliated with ABC/Touchstone TV in any way''". --''[[User:Abu badali|Abu badali]] <sup>([[User_talk:Abu badali|talk]])</sup>'' 15:00, 16 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::What? Maybe not the original nomination, but see my comment at 19:28, 13 March 2007 (UTC). Whether it's in the "original" nomination is besides the point. This isn't about a "good faith belief" in the uploader; rather, it's about the uploader providing convincing evidence to the contrary &mdash; the uploader's source ''obviously'' isn't a source for promotional images. &mdash; '''[[User:Rebelguys2|Rebelguys2]]''' <sup><font color="#CC5500">[[User talk:Rebelguys2|talk]]</font></sup> 17:26, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::: The source of this image is ABC, who owns the copyright to the image, and the image is used under "fair use". WP could use ''any'' image under a fair use claim - this particular one was chosen because it was a promotional photo, but its status as such is incidental to the fair use claim. If you wish to dispute the promotional status because the notice on the fansite isn't good enough, I said above that was fine. The promotional status has little effect on the fair use claim. Do you have any suggestions for how to resolve this nomination? [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 18:55, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::::When I first checked on this image, it claimed fair use based on it being a promotional photograph. Is there any evidence that it's a promotional photograph? No. It's not automatically a promotional photograph just because it's from ABC/Touchstone. When I returned to this image, it claimed fair use based on its status as both a promotional photograph and a TV screenshot. It's not a promotional photograph (I explained that earlier), and the evidence seems to point to the fact that it may not be a TV screenshot (it was pulled off the Web). If you can source it and license correctly (please see [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use]]), there's no problem. I nominated this image originally because it was licensed incorrectly and there was no fair use rationale. I see that a fair use rationale has been added, but there still isn't a good license. The solution is simple, and I've told you this many times in the past &mdash; source and license the image correctly (again. [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use]]) or have the image deleted. There are no alternatives, since this isn't a free image. &mdash; '''[[User:Rebelguys2|Rebelguys2]]''' <sup><font color="#CC5500">[[User talk:Rebelguys2|talk]]</font></sup> 23:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::::: It does use a template from [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use]]. To the best of my knowledge, use of this image is claimed under fair use, not the terms of the promotional license, so {{tl|Non-free fair use in}} seems the most appropriate licensing tag. As required by FU #10 the source is ABC who is also the copyright holder. This (and the fact that it was a promotional image) can be verified by contacting the ABC archive department. What else needs to be done? [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 03:47, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::::::{{tl|Non-free fair use in}} could work; why didn't you make that kind of a fair use claim in the first place?
::::::::I did back on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ACindy.jpg&diff=114747002&oldid=114661241 13th,] someone else deleted that and added the screenshot template.
:::::::::I went ahead and searched for this image's status as a promotional image. First, I went to ABC.com's LOST Web site [http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/ here]. Click on "photos" --> "Season 2" --> "07 The Other 48 Days," and then scroll over to photo 18. There it is! Unfortunately, the terms of use and copyright notice on the Web site do not indicate that it is a promotional image.
:::::::::So, I went over to the Web site for ABC Television Studio Press, where I figured I'd be able to find a repository of press photos. Indeed I did; however, after scanning through the 667 images, I was unable to locate the image in question.
:::::::::All evidence points toward the fact that this is not a promotional image. The ABC.com site ''explicitly notes'' that the image is ''not'' a promotional image. This is why I don't understand where you continue to get the idea that it is a promotional image. I will be removing the promotional image fair use claim if you still don't have any evidence to the contrary.
:::::::::Remember, I have ''never'' based this nominated for deletion solely on the claim that this image should be deleted because we can't prove that it's a promotional photo. Rather, I claimed that the fair use claim was invalid, because all of the evidence said that it wasn't a promotional photo, and because it was missing a fair use rationale. I never deviated from those claims until they finally got fixed &mdash; the fair use claim was changed, and the rationale was added. You're right &mdash; it doesn't have to be a promotional photo to be used under a fair use claim. I never claimed otherwise; you've simply been putting words in my mouth. &mdash; '''[[User:Rebelguys2|Rebelguys2]]''' <sup><font color="#CC5500">[[User talk:Rebelguys2|talk]]</font></sup> 05:25, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::::: Is this done then? The image is not a currently available promotional photo, but it can be requested through the archive department of ABCMedianet.com. The oldest images there appear to be from the end of season three, and this is from the beginning of season three. However, the standard promotional license probably is not useful because these images are typically licensed on a per-site basis, and a WP-only license doesn't help. I considered contacting ABC about this, but I not sure what to even ask for. [[User_talk:Gimmetrow|''Gimmetrow'']] 13:22, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::::::How did you know the image was from ABCMedianet.com? &mdash; '''[[User:Rebelguys2|Rebelguys2]]''' <sup><font color="#CC5500">[[User talk:Rebelguys2|talk]]</font></sup> 03:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
:::'''Keep''' I uploaded a lower resolution version, removed the watermark and wrote a fair use rationale.  --[[User:Thedemonhog|thedemonhog]] 23:55, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
::::It has nothing to do with resolution. We need to know the original image source (i.e. when/where was the image released) in order to be able to claim fair use. You rationale, for instance, fails when it says "''ABC does not lose any rights to sell and advertise''", because we don't know how did ABC planned to use this image. If the image was intended to improve their official website, making it distinguishable from other websites by containing exclusive material, then our use certainly hurts the copyright holder. It the image was intended to be licensed only for some specific members of the media, through exclusivity deals, then our use certainly hurts the copyright holder. The point is, we can never say "''ABC does not lose any rights''" without verifiable information on when and where was this image released.
