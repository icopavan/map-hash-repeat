'''Otago''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ɵ|ˈ|t|ɑː|ɡ|oʊ}}; {{IPA-endia|əˈtaːɡɐʉ|local|En-nz-Otago.ogg}}) is a [[regions of New Zealand|region of New Zealand]] in the south of the [[South Island]]. The region covers an area of approximately {{convert|32000|km2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orc.govt.nz/Portal.asp?nextscreenid=201.102.101.101&categoryid=29&sessionx=40992E79-04DA-4C7C-AD3E-898B26E6F896#size|title=About the Otago region|publisher=Otago Regional Council}}</ref> making it the country's second largest region. The population of Otago is {{NZ population data|Otago Region|y|y|y| from the |.}}

The name "Otago" is an old southern Maori word whose North Island dialect equivalent is "Otakou", introduced to the south by Europeans in the 1840s.<ref>Peter Entwisle, ''Behold the Moon: The European Occupation of the Dunedin District 1770-1848'', Dunedin, NZ: Port Daniel Press, 1998 (ISBN 0-473-05591-0), appendix 1 pp.136-139.</ref> The exact meaning of the term is disputed, with common translations being "isolated village" and "place of red earth", the latter referring to the reddish-ochre clay which is common in the area around Dunedin. "Otago" is also the old name of the European settlement on the [[Otago Harbour]], established by the [[Weller Brothers]] in 1831. The place later became the focus of the Otago Association, an offshoot of the Free Church of Scotland, notable for its high-minded adoption of the principle that ordinary people, not the landowner, should choose the ministers.

Major centres of what is now the Otago Region of the old province include [[Dunedin, New Zealand|Dunedin]] (the principal city of the region), [[Oamaru]] (made famous by [[Janet Frame]]), [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]], [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], and the major tourist centres [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] and [[Wanaka]]. [[Kaitangata, New Zealand|Kaitangata]] in [[South Otago]] is a prominent source of [[coal]]. The [[Waitaki River|Waitaki]] and [[Clutha River|Clutha]] rivers also provide much of the country's [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power. Some parts of the area originally covered by Otago Province are now administered as part of [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland Region]].

New Zealand's first university, The [[University of Otago]], was founded in [[1869]] as the provincial university in [[Dunedin]].

The [[Central Otago wine]] area produces award winning [[Central Otago wine|wine]]s made from varieties such as the [[Pinot Noir]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Sauvignon Blanc]], [[Merlot]], and [[Riesling]] grapes. Central Otago has an increasing reputation as New Zealand’s leading pinot noir region.<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Otago wine success at home and abroad|date=2006-11-11|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK0611/S00117.htm|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>

The region is administered by the [[Otago Regional Council]].

==History==
{{main|History of Otago}}

The Otago settlement, an outgrowth of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]], materialised in March 1848 with the arrival of the first two immigrant ships from [[Greenock]] on the [[Firth of Clyde]] -- the ''[[John Wickliffe (ship)|John Wickliffe]]'' and the ''Philip Laing''. Captain [[William Cargill]], a veteran of the [[Peninsular War]], was the secular leader: Otago citizens subsequently elected him to the office of provincial Superintendent after the provinces were created in 1852. The Otago Province was the whole of New Zealand from the Waitaki river south, including Stewart Island and the sub-Antarctic islands. It included the territory of the later Southland province and also the much more extensive lands of the modern Southland Region.

Initial settlement was concentrated on the port and city, then expanded, notably to the south-west, where the fertile [[Taieri Plains]] offered good farmland.
The 1860s saw rapid commercial expansion after [[Gabriel Read]] discovered gold at [[Gabriel's Gully]] near [[Lawrence, New Zealand|Lawrence]], and the [[Central Otago goldrush]] ensued. Veterans of goldfields in California and Australia, plus many other fortune-seekers from Europe, North America and China, poured into the then [[Provinces of New Zealand|Province]] of Otago, eroding its Scottish [[Presbyterian]] character. Further gold discoveries at [[Clyde, New Zealand|Clyde]] and on the Arrow River round [[Arrowtown]] led to a boom, and Otago became for a period the cultural and economic centre of New Zealand. New Zealand's first daily [[newspaper]], the ''[[Otago Daily Times]]'', originally edited by [[Julius Vogel]], dates from this period.

The [[Provinces of New Zealand|Province]] of [[Southland Province|Southland]] separated from [[Otago Province]] and set up its own Provincial Council at [[Invercargill]] in 1861. After difficulties ensued, Otago re-absorbed it in 1870. Its territory is included in the southern region of the old Otago Province which is named after it and is now the territory of the Southland [[Regions of New Zealand|region]].

The provincial governments were abolished in 1876 when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 Nov 1876,<ref>[http://rulers.org/newzprov.html New Zealand Provinces 1848-77]</ref> and were replaced by other forms of local authority, including counties. Two in Otago were named after the Scottish independence heroes [[William Wallace|Wallace]] and [[Robert I of Scotland|Bruce]]. From this time the national limelight gradually shifted northwards.

==Economy==
The sub-national GDP of the Otago region was estimated at US$5.411 billion in 2003, 4% of New Zealand's national GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/reports/analytical-reports/regional-gross-domestic-product.aspx|title=Regional Gross Domestic Product|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|year=2007|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[Image:OtagoRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right|220px| A map showing population density in the Otago Region at the 2006 census.]]
[[Image:Flag of Otago.svg|thumb|250px|left|[[Flag of Otago|Flag of the Otago Regional Council.]]]]

Beginning in the west, the geography of Otago consists of high alpine mountains. The highest peak in Otago is [[Mount Aspiring/Tititea]], which is on the Main Divide. From the high mountains the rivers discharge into large glacial lakes. In this part of Otago [[glacial]] activity - both recent and very old - dominates the landscape, with large 'U' shaped valleys and rivers which have high sediment loads. River flows also vary dramatically, with large flood flows occurring after heavy rain. Lakes Wakatipu, Wanaka and Hawea form the sources of the Clutha, the largest river (by discharge) in New Zealand. The Clutha flows through Otago and discharges near [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]].

Travelling east from the mountains, the Central Otago drylands predominate. These are [[Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands]] dominated by the block mountains, upthrust [[schist]] mountains. In contrast to Canterbury, where the Northwest winds blow across the plains without interruption, in Otago the block mountains impede and dilute the effects of the [[Nor'west arch|Nor'wester]].

The main Central Otago centres, such as [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]] and [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], are found in the intermontane basins between the block mountains. The schist bedrock influence extends to the eastern part of Otago, where remnant volcanics mark its edge. The remains of the most spectacular of these are the Miocene volcanics centred on [[Otago Harbour]]. Elsewhere, basalt outcrops can be found along the coast and at other sites.

In the southeastern corner of Otago lies [[The Catlins]], an area of rough hill country which geologically forms part of the Murihiku [[terrane]], an accretion which extends inland through the [[Hokonui Hills]] in the [[Southland Region]]. This itself forms part of a larger system known as the Southland [[Syncline]], which links to similar formations in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] (offset by the [[Alpine Fault]]) and even in [[New Caledonia]], {{convert|3500|km|mi|abbr=on}} away.<ref name="Heads1989">Heads, Michael (1989). [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=mypPBKZTdKEC&pg=PA572 Integrating earth and life sciences in New Zealand natural history: the parallel arcs model], ''New Zealand Journal of Zoology'' 16, 549–585.</ref> The Catlins ranges are [[strike ridge]]s composed of [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] [[sandstone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and other related sedimentary rocks, often with a high incidence of [[feldspar]]. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic [[New Zealand geologic time scale|Warepan and Kaihikuan]] stages are found in the area.

==Climate==
Weather conditions vary enormously across Otago, but can be broken into two broad types: the coastal climate of the coastal regions and the more continental climate of the interior.

Coastal regions of Otago are subject to the alternating warm and dry/cool and wet weather patterns common to the interannual [[Southern oscillation]]. The Southern Hemisphere storm track produces an irregular short cycle of weather which repeats roughly every week, with three or four days of fine weather followed by three or four days of cooler, damp conditions. Drier conditions are often the result of the [[Nor'west arch|northwesterly]] [[föhn]] wind, which dries as it crosses the [[Southern Alps]]. Wetter air is the result of approaching low-pressure systems which sweep fronts over the country from the southwest. A common variant in this pattern is the centring of a stationary low-pressure zone to the southeast of the country, resulting in long-lasting cool, wet conditions. These have been responsible for several notable historical floods, such as the "hundred year floods" of October 1878 and October 1978.

Typically, winters are cool and wet in the extreme south areas and Snow can fall and settle to sea level in winter, especially in the hills and plains of [[South Otago]]. More Central and Northern Coastal areas winter is sunnier and drier. Summers, by contrast, tend to be warm and dry, with temperatures often reaching the high 20s and low 30s Celsius.

In [[Central Otago]] cold frosty winters are succeeded by hot dry summers. Central Otago's climate is the closest approximation to a continental climate anywhere in New Zealand. This climate is part of the reason why [[Central Otago wines|Central Otago vineyards]] are successful growing is this region. This inland region is one of the driest regions in the country, sheltered from prevailing rain-bearing weather conditions by the high mountains to the west and hills of the south. Summers can be hot, with temperatures often approaching or exceeding 30 degrees Celsius; winters, by contrast, are often bitterly cold - the township of [[Ophir, New Zealand|Ophir]] in Central Otago holds the New Zealand record for lowest temperature with a reading of -21.6 °C on 3 July 1995.

==Population==
The population of Otago is {{NZ population data|Otago Region|y|}}, which is approximately {{Decimals|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|Otago Region|y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|New Zealand|y}}|R}}*100|1}} percent of New Zealand’s total population of {{Decimals|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|New Zealand|y}}|R}}/1000000|1}} million. About {{Decimals|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|Dunedin|y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data|Otago Region|y}}|R}}*100|1}} percent of the population resides in the Dunedin urban area&mdash;the region’s main city and the country’s sixth largest urban area. For historical and geographical reasons, Dunedin is usually regarded as one of New Zealand's four main centres. Unlike other southern centres, Dunedin’s population has not declined since the 1970s due to the presence of the [[University of Otago]] especially its [[University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine|medical school]] which attracts students from all over New Zealand and overseas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/11|title=Otago region: Population and employment since 1920|last=Mckinnon|first=Malcolm|date=17 August 2009|publisher=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>

Other significant urban centres in Otago with populations over 1,000 include: [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], [[Oamaru]], [[Wanaka]], [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]], [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], [[Balclutha, New Zealand|Balclutha]], [[Milton, New Zealand|Milton]] and [[Mosgiel]]. Between 1996 and 2006, the population of the [[Queenstown Lakes District]] grew by 60% due to the region’s booming [[tourism]] industry.<ref name="orr">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/otago-region/1|title=Otago region: Overview|last=Mckinnon|first=Malcolm|date=19 August 2009|publisher=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>

Approximately 80% of the region’s population is of European lineage with the majority being of [[Scotland|Scottish]] stock&mdash;the descendants of early Scottish settlers from the early 19th century. Maori comprise approximately 7% of the population with a large proportion being from the [[Ngāi Tahu]] [[iwi]] or tribe. Other significant ethnic minorities include Asians, Pacific Islanders, Africans, Latin Americans and Middle Easterners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2006CensusHomePage/QuickStats/AboutAPlace/SnapShot.aspx?type=region&ParentID=1000001&tab=Culturaldiversity&id=1000014|title=QuickStats About Otago: Cultural Diversity|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|accessdate=2010-02-18}}</ref>

==Politics==
===Representation===
Otago is divided into four [[New Zealand Parliament|parliamentary]] [[electoral district|electorate]]s with the city of [[Dunedin]] comprising two of these. The [[Dunedin North (New Zealand electorate)|Dunedin North]] electorate is held by [[Pete Hodgson]] while the [[Dunedin South]] electorate is occupied by [[Clare Curran]]. Both MPs are members of the opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] while Dunedin has traditionally been a Labour stronghold.

Since 2008, the former electorate of Otago has been split and merged into the large rural electorates of [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki]] which also includes some of the neighbouring [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] Region, and the [[Clutha-Southland]] electorate, which also includes most of the rural part of the neighbouring Southland Region. The Waitaki electorate has traditionally been a [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] stronghold and is currently held by [[Jacqui Dean]]. The Clutha-Southland electorate, also a National Party stronghold, is currently held by [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Bill English]].

Under the [[Māori seats]] system, Otago is also part of the large [[Te Tai Tonga (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tonga]] electorate, which covers the entire South Island and surrounding islands. This is currently held by [[Māori Party]] MP [[Rahui Katene]].

===Administration===
The seat of the ''Otago Regional Council'' is in [[Dunedin]]. There are five [[Territorial Authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]] in the Otago region:
* [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown-Lakes District]]
* [[Central Otago|Central Otago District]]
* [[Dunedin|Dunedin City]]
* [[Clutha District]]
* [[Waitaki, New Zealand|Waitaki District]]
