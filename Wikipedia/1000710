The '''Battle of the Barents Sea''' took place on 31 December 1942 between [[Nazi Germany|German]] surface raiders and British ships escorting [[convoy]] [[JW convoys|JW]]&nbsp;51B to [[Kola Inlet]] in the [[USSR]]. The action took place in the [[Barents Sea]] north of [[North Cape, Norway]]. The German raiders failure to inflict heavy losses on the convoy infuriated Hitler who ordered that German naval strategy would focus on the U-boat fleet, shunting the surface ships aside. 

==Approach==
[[Convoy JW 51B]] comprised fourteen merchant ships carrying war materials to the [[USSR]] — some 202 tanks, 2,046 other vehicles, 87 fighters, 33 bombers, {{convert|11500|ST|t|abbr=on}} of fuel, {{convert|12650|ST|t|abbr=on}} of aviation fuel and just over {{convert|54000|ST|t|abbr=on}} of other supplies. They were protected by the [[destroyer]]s {{HMS|Achates|H12|6}}, {{HMS|Orwell|G98|2}}, {{HMS|Oribi|G66|2}}, {{HMS|Onslow|G17|2}}, {{HMS|Obedient|G48|2}} and {{HMS|Obdurate|G39|2}}; [[Flower class corvette|Flower-class]] corvettes {{HMS|Rhododendron|K78|6}} and {{HMS|Hyderabad|K212|2}}; the [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{HMS|Bramble|J11|6}}; and [[Naval trawler|trawler]]s ''Vizalma'' and ''Northern Gem''. The escort commander was [[Captain (navy)|Captain]] [[Robert St Vincent Sherbrooke|R. St.V. Sherbrooke]] RN (flag in ''Onslow''). The convoy sailed in the dead of winter to preclude attacks by German aircraft like those that devastated an earlier Arctic convoy, [[Convoy PQ-17|PQ-17]].

In addition to the convoy escort, two [[cruisers]] — {{HMS|Sheffield|C24|6}} and {{HMS|Jamaica|44|2}} — and two destroyers were independently stationed in the [[Barents Sea]] to provide distant cover. These four ships, known as "Force&nbsp;R", were under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Robert L. Burnett]], in ''Sheffield''.

The German forces included the [[heavy cruiser]] {{Ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}; [[Deutschland class cruiser|large cruiser]] ''[[German cruiser Deutschland|Lützow]]''; and [[destroyer]]s ''[[German destroyer Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt|Friedrich Eckholdt]]'', ''[[German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen|Richard Beitzen]]'', ''[[German destroyer Z6 Theodor Riedel|Theodor Riedel]]'', ''Z&nbsp;29'', ''Z&nbsp;30'' and ''Z&nbsp;31''. These ships were based at [[Alta, Norway|Altafjord]] in northern Norway, and were under the overall command of Vice-Admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]], in ''Hipper''.

Convoy JW 51B sailed from Loch Ewe on 22 December 1942 and met its escort off [[Iceland]] on 25 December. From there the ships sailed northeast, meeting heavy gales on 28–29 December that caused the ships of the convoy to lose station. When the weather moderated, five merchantmen and the escorts ''Oribi'' and ''Vizalma'' were missing. ''Bramble'' was detached to search for them. Three of the straggling merchantmen rejoined the following day; the other ships proceeded independently towards Kola Inlet.

Meanwhile, on 30 December, the convoy was sighted by [[German submarine U-354|''U-354'']] (''Kptlt.'' Karl-Heinz Herbschleb).<ref>[http://www.uboat.net/boats/u354.htm ''U-354'' at U-boat.net]</ref> When the report was received by the German Naval Staff, Kummetz was ordered to sail immediately to intercept the convoy. Kummetz split his force into two divisions, led by ''Hipper'' and ''Lützow'', respectively.

==The battle==
[[File:Battle of the Barents Sea.jpg|thumb|Battle of the Barents Sea]]

The encounter took place in the middle of the [[polar night]] and both the German and British forces were scattered and unsure of the positions of the rest of their own forces, much less the enemy's. Thus the entire battle became a rather confused affair. During the battle it was not clear who was firing on whom or even how many ships were engaged.

At 08:00 on 31 December, the main body of JW 51B, twelve ships and eight warships, were some 120 miles north of the coast of [[Finnmark]] heading east. Detached from the convoy were the destroyer ''Oribi'' and one ship, which took no part in the action; 15 miles astern (north-east) of the convoy ''Bramble'' was searching for them. North of the convoy, at 45 miles distance, was ''Vizalma'' and another ship, while Burnett's cruisers were 15 miles southeast of them, and 30 miles from the convoy. to the east, 150 miles away, the home-bound convoy RA 51 was heading west. To the north of the convoy, ''Hipper'' and three destroyers were closing, while 50 miles away ''Lützow'' and her three destroyers were closing from the south. At 08:00 the destroyer ''Eckholdt'' sighted the convoy and reported it to ''Hipper''.<ref>Kemp p. 118.</ref>

At 08:20 on 31 December, ''Obdurate'', stationed south of the convoy, spotted three German destroyers to the rear (west) of the convoy. Then, ''Onslow'' spotted ''Admiral Hipper'', also to the rear of the convoy, and steered to intercept with ''Orwell'', ''Obedient'' and ''Obdurate'', while ''Achates'' was ordered to stay with the convoy and make smoke. After some firing, the British ships turned to make a feigned [[torpedo]] attack. Heavily outgunned, Sherbrooke knew that his torpedoes were his most formidable weapons and once launched, that threat would be gone. The ruse worked: ''Hipper'' temporarily retired, since Kummetz had been ordered not to risk his ships. ''Admiral Hipper'' returned to make a second attack, hitting ''Onslow'' causing heavy damage and many casualties including 17 killed. Although ''Onslow'' ultimately survived the action, Sherbrooke had been badly injured by a large steel splinter and command passed to ''Obedient''.

''Hipper'' then pulled north of the convoy, stumbled across ''Bramble'', a [[Halcyon class minesweeper|''Halcyon''-class minesweeper]], which opened fire; ''Hipper'' returned fire with her much heavier guns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/92/a5350592.shtml|title=''Article ID: A5350592.'' Russian Convoy JW51B, Official Report, HMS Achates, HMS Bramble|date=27 August 2005|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref> The destroyer ''Eckholdt'' was ordered to finish ''Bramble'' off, while the ''Admiral Hipper'' shifted target to ''Obedient'' and ''Achates'' to the south. ''Achates'' was badly damaged, but she continued to lay down smoke until she eventually sank. (The trawler ''Northern Gem'' rescued many of the crew of ''Achates''.) The Germans reported sinking a destroyer, but this was on the basis of the sinking the minesweeper ''Bramble'', which they mistook for a destroyer. They never realised ''Achates'' had been hit.

All this firing attracted the attention of Force&nbsp;R, which was still farther north. ''[[HMS Sheffield (C24)|Sheffield]]'' and ''[[HMS Jamaica (44)|Jamaica]]'' approached unseen, and they opened fire on ''Admiral Hipper'' at 11:35, hitting her with enough six-inch shells to damage (and cause minor flooding) to two of her boiler rooms, and dropping her speed to 28 knots. Kummetz initially thought that the attack of the two cruisers was coming from another destroyer, but upon realising his mistake, he ordered his ships to retreat to the west. In another case of mistaken identity, ''Eckholdt'' and ''Richard Beitzen'' mistook ''Sheffield'' for ''Admiral Hipper''; after attempting to form up with the British ships, they were engaged, and ''Eckholdt'' broke into two and sank with all hands by ''Sheffield'' as ''Bramble'' had been.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.german-navy.de/kriegsmarine/articles/feature5.html|title=Battle of the Barents Sea|last=Irwin J. Kappes|date=23 February 2010|publisher=German-Navy.De|accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref>

Meanwhile, ''Lützow'' approached from the east and fired ineffectively at the convoy (which was still hidden by smoke from the crippled ''Achates''). Heading northwest to join ''Admiral Hipper'', ''Lützow'' also found ''Sheffield'' and ''Jamaica'', which opened fire. Coincidentally, both sides decided to break off the action at the same time, each side fearing imminent torpedo attacks upon their heavy ships from the other's remaining destroyers. This was shortly after noon. Burnett with Force&nbsp;R continued to shadow the German ships at a distance until it was evident that they were retiring to their base, while the ships of the convoy re-formed and continued towards Kola Inlet.

==Aftermath==
Despite this German attack on convoy JW&nbsp;51B, all fourteen of its merchant ships reached their destinations in the USSR.

Even more critically for the outcome of the war, [[Adolf Hitler]] was infuriated at what he perceived as the uselessness of the surface raiders, seeing that two heavy cruisers were driven off by mere destroyers. There were serious implications: this failure nearly made Hitler enforce a decision to scrap the surface fleet, and for the German Navy to concentrate on [[U-boat]] warfare. Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], supreme commander of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'', offered his resignation&mdash;which Hitler accepted, apparently reluctantly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Raeder was replaced by Admiral [[Karl Dönitz]], the commander of the U-boat fleet, who saved the German surface fleet from scrapping (though ''Hipper'', and several light cruisers, were laid up), but many of those same ships including ''Hipper'' and ''Lützow'' were bombed and sunk later during the British bombing campaign of the first 4 months of 1945, and only ''[[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]'', ''[[German cruiser Nürnberg|Nürnberg]]'', with 20-odd destroyers survived the war afloat.

Aside from the E-boats operating off the coast of France, the only major surface operation ever completed following the battle was the attempted raid on [[Convoy JW 55B]] by the battleship {{Ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, but she was sunk by an escorting British task force in what is later known as the [[Battle of the North Cape]]. 

On the British side, Captain [[Robert St Vincent Sherbrooke]] was awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]. He generously acknowledged that it had truthfully been awarded in honour of the whole crew of ''Onslow''. In the action he had been badly wounded, and had lost the sight in one eye. However, he returned to active duty, and retired from the navy in the 1950s, with the rank of [[Rear-Admiral]].

At the memorial for ''Bramble'', Captain Harvey Crombie stated of the crew: "They had braved difficulties and perils probably unparalleled in the annals of the British Navy, and calls upon their courage and endurance were constant, but they never failed. They would not have us think sadly at this time, but rather that we should praise God that they had remained steadfast to duty to the end."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halcyon-class.co.uk/Bramble/bramble1942.htm|title=HMS Bramble 1942|date=7 November 2010|publisher=halcyon-class.co.uk|accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref>

Also, the battle became the subject of the book ''73 North'' by [[Dudley Pope]].
