In [[military science]], '''engineering''' refers to the practice of designing, building, maintaining and dismantling military works, including offensive, defensive and logistical structures, to shape the physical operating environment in [[war]]. It most often deals with fortifications and earthworks, the laying and clearing [[land mine|minefields]], and the construction and destruction of [[bridge]]s.

According to NATO, "Military Engineering is that engineer activity undertaken, regardless of component or service, to shape the physical operating environment.' Military Engineering incorporates support to manoeuvre and to the force as a whole, including military engineering functions such as engineer support to Force Protection, Counter - Improvised Explosive Devices, Environmental Protection, Engineer Intelligence and Military Search. Military Engineering does not encompass the activities undertaken by those 'engineers' who maintain, repair and operate vehicles, vessels, aircraft, weapon systems and equipment." <ref>{{Cite book|title=MC 0560 "MILITARY COMMITTEE POLICY FOR MILITARY ENGINEERING"|author=NATO publication|year=01 Apr 2008|publisher=NATO}}</ref>

Military engineering is an important academic subject taught in [[military academies]]. The construction and demolition tasks related to military engineering are usually performed by military engineers including [[soldier]]s trained as [[sapper]]s or [[Pioneer (military)|pioneer]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Crossbow to H-bomb|author=Bernard Brodie, Fawn McKay Brodie|year=1973 |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253201616}}</ref> In modern armies, soldiers trained to perform such tasks while well forward in battle and under fire are often called [[combat engineer]]s. 

In some countries, military engineers may also perform non-military construction tasks in peacetime such as [[flood control]] and river navigation works, but such activities do not fall within the scope of military engineering.

==Origins==
The word ''engineer'' was initially used in the context of warfare, dating back to 1325 when ''engine’er'' (literally, one who operates an engine) referred to "a constructor of military engines".<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]</ref> In this context, "engine" referred to a military machine, i. e., a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]).

As the design of civilian structures such as bridges and buildings matured as a technical discipline, the term ''[[civil engineering]]''<ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9105842/engineering Engineers' Council for Professional Development definition on Encyclopaedia Britannica] (Includes Britannica article on Engineering)</ref> entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the older discipline.  As the prevalence of civil engineering outstripped engineering in a military context and the number of disciplines expanded, the original military meaning of the word “engineering” is now largely obsolete.  In its place, the term "military engineering" has come to be used.

==History==
Perhaps the first civilization to have a dedicated force of military engineering specialists were the Romans, whose army contained a dedicated corps of military engineers known as [[Roman military engineering]] was pre-eminent amongst its contemporaries, and the scale of certain military engineering feats, such as the construction of a double-wall of fortifications {{convert|30|mi|km}} long in total (both walls combined total) in just six weeks to completely encircle the besieged city of Alesia in 52 B.C. Such military engineering feats would have been completely new, and probably bewildering and demoralizing, to the Gallic defenders. The best known of these Roman army engineers due to his writings surviving is [[Vitruvius]].

In ancient times, military engineers were responsible for [[siege warfare]] and building field [[fortifications]], temporary camps and roads. The most notable engineers of ancient times were the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[China|Chinese]], who constructed huge siege-machines (catapults, [[battering rams]] and [[siege tower]]s) and were responsible for constructing fortified wooden camps and paved roads for their [[Roman legion|legions]]. Many of these [[Roman road]]s are still in use today.

For 500 years after the fall of the Roman empire, the practice of military engineering barely evolved in the west.  In fact, much of the classic techniques and practices of Roman military engineering was lost.  Through this period, the foot soldier (who was pivotal to much of the Roman military engineering capabiltiy) was largely replaced by mounted soldiers.  It was not until later in the [[Middle Ages]] military engineering saw a revival focused on siege warfare. <ref>Canadian Forces Publication, A-JS-007-003/JD-001 Customs and Traditions of the Canadian Military Engineers. 30 June 2003[http://www.cmea-agmc.ca/redbook/CME_Customs_e.pdf]</ref>

Military engineers planned castles and fortresses. When laying siege, they planned and oversaw efforts to penetrate castle defences. When [[castle]]s served a military purpose, one of the tasks of the sappers was to weaken the bases of walls to enable them to be breached before means of thwarting these activities were devised. Broadly speaking, sappers were experts at demolishing or otherwise overcoming or bypassing fortification systems.

With the 14th century development of [[gunpowder]], new [[siege engine]]s in the form of [[cannon]]s appeared. Initially military engineers were responsible for maintaining and operating these new weapons just as had been the case with previous siege engines. In England, the challenge of managing the new technology resulted in the creation of the [[Board of Ordnance|Office of Ordnance]] around 1370 in order to administer the cannons, armaments and castles of the kingdom. Both military engineers and [[artillery]] formed the body of this organization and served together until the office's predecessor, the Board of Ordnance was disbanded in 1855.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Museum  | first = Royal Engineers|title = Corps History - Part 2| url=http://www.remuseum.org.uk/corpshistory/rem_corps_part2.htm | accessdate = 12 January 2010 }}</ref>

In comparison to older weapons, the cannon was significantly more effective against traditional [[medieval fortification]]s. Military engineering significantly revised the way fortifications were built in order to be better protected from enemy direct and plunging shot. The new fortifications were also intended to increase the ability of defenders to bring fire onto attacking enemies. Fort construction proliferated in 16th century Europe based on the ''[[trace italienne]]'' design.<ref>Langins,Janis. ''Conserving the Enlightenment: French Military Engineering from Vauban to the Revolution''.  Cambridge, Mass.  MIT Press.  2004.</ref>

By the 18th century, regiments of foot (infantry) in the British, French, Prussian and other armies included pioneer detachments. In peacetime these specialists constituted the regimental tradesmen, constructing and repairing buildings, transport wagons, etc. On active service they moved at the head of marching columns with axes, shovels and pickaxes clearing obstacles or building bridges to open the way for the bulk of the regiment to move through difficult terrain. The modern [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] and [[French Foreign Legion]] still maintain pioneer sections who march at the front of ceremonial parades, carrying chromium plated tools intended for show only. Other historic distinctions include long work aprons and the right to wear beards.

The dawn of the [[internal combustion engine]] marked the beginning of a very significant change for military engineering. With the arrival of the [[History of the automobile|automobile]] at the end of the 19th century and [[Aviation history#Heavier than air|heavier than air flight]] at the start of the 20th century, military engineers would absorbe a major new role to support the movement and deployment of these systems in war. Military engineers gained vast knowledge and experience in [[explosive]]s. They are tasked with planting bombs, [[land mine|landmines]] and [[dynamite]].

At the end of [[World War I]], the standoff in the Western Front caused the Imperial German Army to gather experienced and particularly skilled soldiers to form "Assault Teams" which would break through the Allied trenches. With enhanced training and special weapons (such as [[flamethrowers]]), these squads obtained some success, but too late to change the outcome of the war. In early WWII, however, the [[Wehrmacht]] "Pioniere" battalions proved their efficiency in both attack and defense, somewhat inspiring other armies to develop their own combat engineers battalions. Notably, the attack on Fort [[Eben-Emael]] in Belgium was conducted by Luftwaffe [[military glider|glider]]-deployed combat engineers.

The need to defeat the German defensive positions of the "[[Atlantic wall]]" as part of the amphibious landings in Normandy in 1944 led to the development of specialist combat engineer vehicles. These, collectively known as [[Hobart's Funnies]], included a specific vehicle to carry combat engineers, the [[Churchill tank|Churchill AVRE]]. These and other dedicated assault vehicles were organised into the specialised [[79th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|79th Armoured Division]] and deployed during [[Operation Overlord]] - 'D-Day'.  

Other significant military engineering projects of [[World War II]] include the [[Mulberry harbour]] and [[Operation Pluto]].

Modern military engineering still retains the Roman role of building field [[fortification]]s, road paving and the breaching of terrain obstacles. A notable military engineering task was, for example, the breaching of the [[Suez Canal]] during the [[Yom Kippur War]].

==Multi-national Institutions==

The [[NATO]] Military Engineering Center of Excellence (MilEng CoE) is co-located with the [[German Army]] Military Engineer School in [[Ingolstadt]]. Prior to becoming a NATO CoE, the institute was known as the Euro NATO Training Engineer Centre (ENTEC) and it was located in [[Munich]]. As ENTEC, the institute was mandated to conduct military engineer interoperability training for participating nations. As the MilEng CoE, the institute's mandate has expanded to include doctrine and NATO standardization agreements ([[STANAG]]s) related to military engineering.
