'''oDesk''' is a company with a global job [[marketplace]] and a series of tools targeted at businesses that intend to hire and manage [[Mobile and remote working|remote workers]]. Based in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City, CA]], oDesk was founded in 2003 by [[Greeks|Greek]] entrepreneurs Odysseas Tsatalos and Stratis Karamanlakis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.odesk.com/w/about-odesk-team|title=oDesk About Us Page|accessdate=7 June 2011}}</ref>

==Background==
oDesk is the largest among a number of companies, including [[Elance]],  [[Freelancer.com|Freelancer]], [[Guru.com|Guru]]  and [[vWorker]] (formerly Rent A Coder), that create marketplaces in which independent contractors and their clients can contact one another. These sites often manage the payments, and make money by charging membership fees and/or take a cut of the payment. The cuts can range from 4 percent to 15 percent. oDesk charges 10% but does not charge a membership fee.<ref name="online.wsj.com"/>

==Description==
oDesk allows clients to create online workteams coordinated and paid through the company's proprietary software and website. The name is a short version of "online desk"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.odesk.com/2007/02/nodeskcom-becomes-odeskcom/ |title=Nodesk.com becomes oDesk.com |date=February 20, 2007 }}</ref> in reference to the company's intent to enable anyone to work anywhere, anytime. Prospective clients can post jobs for free, and freelance workers (“contractors”) may create profiles and bid on jobs, also for free.<ref name="online.wsj.com">{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122347721312915407.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|title=Help Wanted – And Found|author=Raymund Flandez|date=2008-10-13}}</ref> The company collects 10 percent of the payment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.odesk.com/help/help/policies/user_agreement#policies|title=oDesk Policy|date=October 2010}}</ref>  Payments are made through oDesk, which handles many bookkeeping tasks for the transaction.  In addition to the marketplace aspect and the payment/bookkeeping services, the company uses collaborative software, “oDesk Team,” that allows clients to see a provider's progress while he or she is billing time.  

The company describes itself as an online workplace. As of Jan. 10, 2009, the company reports that nearly 37,000 of its 170,000 providers are in the United States{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.  The company's site is entirely in English, and all transactions are made in U.S. dollars.  The site does not post statistics regarding locations of buyer companies. In December 2009, the company's self-reported tally of services paid through its site had passed $113 million.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The specific areas of expertise supported by the site include web development and a wide variety of programming/software development skills, graphic design, writing and administrative support. The company provides voluntary skills tests in various disciplines from English aptitude to specific programming skills, and profiles include a feedback mechanism.

==Financing==
oDesk has raised three rounds of financing. The first was by Globespan Capital and Sigma Partners.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Internet startup oDesk gets $6M funding | date=June 1, 2006 | publisher= | url =http://sanjose.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2006/05/29/daily44.html | work =Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal | pages = | accessdate = | language = }}</ref> The second round was raised in September 2006, led by [[Benchmark Capital]] and included the previous two investors.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=oDesk Announces $8 Million Series B Round Led by Benchmark Capital | date=September 27, 2006 | publisher= | url =http://biz.yahoo.com/iw/060927/0167008.html | work =Yahoo!

==Innovation==

The company's oDesk team software increases transparency and allows a client to have confidence in the billing done by a contractor whom the buyer may never have met and who may be half a world away.  In an October 2008 interview with website Web Worker Daily, CEO Gary Swart said the work diaries “give buyers unprecedented visibility into work performed,” and that the Team software's “hassle-free tracking guarantees convenient, safe, and accurate billing for all work performed.”<ref>{{cite news|url=http://webworkerdaily.com/2008/10/16/interview-odesks-ceo-on-opportunities-for-web-workers/|publisher=Web Worker Daily|title=Interview: oDesk’s CEO on Opportunities for Web Workers|author=Samuel Dean|date=2008-10-16}}</ref>
