The dangers to journalists in Russia have been well known since the early 1990s but concern at the number of unsolved killings soared after [[Anna Politkovskaya]]'s murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006. While international monitors spoke of several dozen deaths, some sources within '''[[Russia]]''' talked of over two hundred fatalities.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0712/09/se.02.html ''Czar Putin'', CNN.]</ref>
The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports, published in Russian and English, by international organizations.

А wide-ranging investigation by the [[International Federation of Journalists]] into the deaths of journalists in Russia was published in June 2009. At the same time the IFJ launched an online database<ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, Deaths and Disappearances: An online database] IFJ. Still under completion, October 2009.</ref><ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/rjournalists ЖУРНАЛИСТЫ В РОССИИ. Смерти и исчезновения. База данных] Международная федерация журналистов.</ref>  which documents over three hundred deaths and disappearances since 1993. Both the report ''Partial Justice''<ref>[http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE: An inquiry into the deaths of journalists in Russia, 1993-2009], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.</ref> (Russian version: ''Частичное правосудие''<ref>[http://www.ruj.ru/2009/pjustice_090909.pdf ЧАСТИЧНОЕ ПРАВОСУДИЕ. Исследование смертей журналистов в России, 1993-2009]. Международная федерация журналистов.</ref>) and the database depend on the information gathered in Russia over the last 16 years by the country's own media monitors, the [[Glasnost Defense Foundation]] and the [[Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations]].

In its September 2009 report the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] repeated its conclusion that Russia was one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists and added that it remains among the worst at solving their murders. ''The Anatomy of Injustice''<ref>[http://cpj.org/reports/CPJ.Anatomy%20of%20Injustice.pdf ANATOMY OF INJUSTICE: The unsolved killings of journalists in Russia], Committee to Protect Journalists: New York, September 2009.</ref> (Russian version: ''Анатомия безнаказанности''<ref>[http://cpj.org/ru/CPJ.%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%8F%20%D0%B1%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8.pdf АНАТОМИЯ БЕЗНАКАЗАННОСТИ. Нераскрытые убийства журналистов в России]. Комитет защиты журналистов.</ref>) offers an account of the deaths of 17 journalists in Russia since 2000. They died or were killed, the CPJ is convinced, because of the work they were doing and in only one case, it notes, has there been a partially successful prosecution.

The IFJ report focuses on the capacity of Russian law enforcement agencies, over a longer period of time, to identify and detain those who have killed journalists.<ref>[http://www.gdf.ru/lenta/item/2/534#eng "Commentary on recent interview with police Major-General Gribakin", 16 February 2009, bulletin of Glasnost Defence Foundation]. Same article in Russian, [http://www.novayagazeta.ru/data/2009/020/31.html «Не сходиться ...» Новая газета, 27 February 2009] on website only.</ref> It adopted a broader approach than the CPJ study, and offered more analysis of change over time. This permitted ''Partial Justice'' to reveal a telling contrast between the rising and successful rate of prosecution for those who have killed journalists in ordinary cases of homicide<ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive:nJ/incident:homicide/impunity:trial,%20conviction JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Convictions for homicide not linked to work"]</ref> and the persistent failure to prosecute or convict those responsible for murders linked to the work of journalists.

== How the figures have been compiled ==
Among international monitors the figures quoted for deaths of journalists in Russia have varied, sometimes considerably. There are several explanations. One, certain organisations are concerned with all aspects of safety in news gathering, and so the International Federation of Journalists and the [[International News Safety Institute]] also record accidents that have occurred at work.<ref>[http://www.newssafety.org/images/pdf/KillingtheMessenger.pdf KILLING THE MESSENGER: The report on the global inquiry into the protection of journalists], INSI: Brussels, 2007.</ref> Two, some monitoring bodies include only fatalities in crossfire and dangerous assignments, and those murders where they feel sure of the motive behind the lethal attack and can with confidence lobby the appropriate government — the CPJ adopts this approach. Three, the term "journalist" is used by monitors as a general term to cover many different occupations within the media. Some include support staff, others do not.

In any list of deaths, compiled by monitors inside or outside the country Russia ranks high. When the killing began the brief first Chechen war took numerous lives, of journalists from within Chechnya and from further afield. This deadly combat zone was then matched by that in the former Yugoslavia, above all in Bosnia. There were also mounting peacetime deaths of journalists elsewhere in the Russian Federation.

Those deliberately targeted for their work have tended to be reporters, correspondents and editors. In Russia many directors of new regional TV and radio stations have been murdered<ref>"Contract killings", p. 21, [http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.</ref><ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/job:director JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Homicide of media directors"]</ref> but most of these deaths are thought to relate to conflicting business interests. Photographers and cameramen are particularly vulnerable in crossfire situations, such as the October 1993 days in Moscow and the armed conflict in the North Caucasus.

Following Russia's media monitors, the IFJ database of deaths and disappearances in Russia embraces the entire range of media occupations and every degree of uncertainty as to the motive for many of the attacks. At the same time it allows for selection and analysis. One, it classifies the way in which a journalist died (homicide, accident, crossfire, terrorist act or not confirmed) and, two, it assesses each death as certainly, possibly,<ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive:xJ JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database,"Deaths possibly linked to work"]</ref> or most probably not, linked to the journalist's work.

Since the early 1990s Russia's media monitors have recorded every violent or suspicious death that came to their attention. Determining which were linked to the work of the journalist concerned has not always been easy since law enforcement agencies in Russia were then struggling to cope with a wave of murders, and the number of unsolved killings of journalists steadily mounted. In the last few years n the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations has gathered all available information about these deaths on its Memorium site.<ref>[http://memorium.cjes.ru/?pid=1&l=Г/ MEMORIUM. Погибшие и пропавшие без вести журналисты]. The site covers the entire Commonwealth of Independent States.</ref> This made it possible to check how far these deaths have been investigated and how many have led to court cases. The IFJ data base summarises the information accumulated on the Memorium site and makes it available in English for the first time.

The most up to date information is that 30% of all the murders committed since 1993 have resulted in prosecutions.<ref>http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/impunity:trial</ref> And if few reached the courts in the early 1990s, in the last few years the proportion has risen to 60% of all acknowledged homicides. This shifts the focus of concern to the quality of justice administered and, in particular, to the failure to solve the minority of very important cases within that total of targeted contract killings linked to the journalist's investigative work and publications.

During a study of international fraud-detection homicide which compared fraud detection homicide cases from the United States of America against fraud detection homicide cases from the former Soviet Republic the murder of Paula Klebenikov illustrated a case of a contract killing of a journalist known to expose fraud in governments.  At the time of his murder, he was thought to be investigating complex money laundering fraud scheme involving Chechen reconstruction projects.  The investigation appears to reveal that Klebnikov had discovered that the fraud reached deep into the centers of power in the Kremlin, elements involving organized crime, and also the former KGB, which is now known as the FSB.<ref>Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2008). [http://www.all-about-psychology.com/support-files/international_fraud_detection_homicide.pdf A Tale of Two Countries: International Fraud-Detection Homicide], Forensic Examiner, 72-78</ref>

== ''Partial Justice'' and ''Anatomy of Injustice'' ==
The IFJ report, ''Partial Justice'', maps the changing contours of impunity in Russia. It shows and explains the ''process'' whereby particular deaths are selected by the IFJ, CPJ and other monitors. It stresses the need for an end to total impunity in those remaining regions (the North Caucasus, St Petersburg) where no one has ever been prosecuted for killing a journalist,<ref name="PARTIAL JUSTICE, June 2009">See charts 2 & 3, [http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE, June 2009]. "Killing with impunity in Russia, 1993-2008", pp. 11, 12.</ref> and for an advance beyond partial justice in those cases where it is known, or strongly suspected, that the murder of a journalist was planned and premeditated. It is not enough to put the killer on trial; he must be accompanied, or followed, by his accomplices, and the intermediaries and individuals who ordered and paid for the killing.

The IFJ report opens and closes with the Politkovskaya murder and the subsequent trial, which ran from November 2008 to February 2009. After 16 years of unsolved killings, the international outcry over her death made this a test case that might finally breach the barrier of partial justice. The evidence presented by the prosecution, unfortunately, did not convince the jury or satisfy other key participants.<ref>See [http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2009/18/00.html "The whole system stands condemned", 20 February 2009, Novaya gazeta]. Transcript of press conference following verdict.</ref> ''Anatomy of Injustice'', the report by the CPJ, displays the ''conclusions'' the Committee has reached about certain deaths since 2000: the authorities do not acknowledge some of these deaths as homicide,<ref>See discussion of Makeyev, Shchekochikhin and Safronov cases, [http://cpj.org/reports/CPJ.Anatomy%20of%20Injustice.pdf ANATOMY OF INJUSTICE, September 2009] pp. 24-25, 26-27,</ref> while several others reached the courts but have led at most to the conviction of the perpetrator, not those who ordered the killing.

Following different routes the two reports reach a similar set of recommendations. They call on the Russian authorities to give investigators and courts the backing they need to identify and pursue all those responsible for the deaths of journalists and, in the meanwhile, to keep press and public better informed about their progress in tackling such disturbing crimes.

== International comparisons ==
The CPJ lists Russia as "the third deadliest country in the world for journalists" since 1991, exceeded in the number of deaths only by Algeria (1993–1996) and post-invasion Iraq.<ref name=cpj2>[http://www.canada.ifex.org/fr/content/view/full/84529/ "Exiled journalists, CPJ brief US congressional caucus on dangers facing Russian journalists"], CPJ news release, 28 June 2007, accessed 8 July 2007.</ref> It is more revealing, perhaps, to set Russia alongside its G20 partners — not just the USA and France, but also Saudi Arabia and China (see Table 1, in IFJ report).<ref>"Some international comparisons", p. 9, [http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.</ref> Russia's problem, shared by certain other members of G20 (India, Brazil and Mexico), is not simply one of the number of deaths but that the killing with impunity has persisted over time.

The varied conditions in these economically important countries highlight a further crucial dimension. The killing of journalists may be the most dramatic and frequently quoted "barometer of press freedom"<ref>[http://www.gdf.ru/digest/item/9/257 Джон Кроуфут, "Барометры свободы", Дайджест ФЗГ, 18 февраля 2008]; in English "Barometers of Freedom", ''Index on Censorship'', Issue 1, 2008.</ref> but it is by no means the only measure. What it signifies for a particular country can only be properly gauged in the wider context of press freedom and other liberties, present (or absent) in that society.<ref>[http://www.rsf.org/How-the-index-was-drawn-up.html "How the index was drawn up", 23 October 2002, Reporters without Borders]</ref> Very few journalists have been killed in China<ref>[http://cpj.org/killed/asia/china/ CPJ: Killed in China since 1992]</ref> and none, it would seem, in North Korea. Other shortcomings ensure those countries occupy a lower position than Russia on any index of press freedom.

And it is important to integrate into an understanding of the media situation those cases where a journalist, such as Mikhail Beketov, has survived an attack aimed at killing him (see below, "Killing not the only measure"). Death in such attacks is just the extreme end of the spectrum of threats and intimidation.

== Deaths and trials, statistics ==
The violent deaths of journalists started in the Yeltsin era (1991–1999) and continued under Putin, president of Russia from 31 December 1999 to 7 May 2008.<ref name="russland">Gabriele Krone-Schmalz, "Press freedom", in
''Was passiert in Russland?'' F.A. Herbig: Munich, 2008 (4th edn.), pp. 81-98 (in German).</ref> When Medvedev became president, he spoke of the need to end "legal nihilism".{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In the past five years, there have been a rising number of trials<ref name="PARTIAL JUSTICE, June 2009"/> but by November 2009 there had yet to be a major breakthrough, under Medvedev, either in the prosecution of pre-2008 deaths or the investigation of killings since his May 2008 inauguration. The Politkovskaya murder trial and the first arrests in the Baburova-Markelov slaying (November 2009) showed some inconclusive signs of movement.

The yearly figures in the table above are derived from the "journalists in Russia" database, where details can be found on each individual death. Certain important categories are not included. Those who have gone "missing" (14 persons);<ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:missing JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Those missing since 1993"]</ref> those who died in an incident ("not confirmed", 28 persons), the nature of which has not been satisfactorily established; and journalists killed in work-related accidents (37 persons),<ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive:J/incident:accident JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Work-related accidents since 1993"]</ref> may be found online in the IFJ database.

The third set of figures indicates the yearly number of verdicts reached in trials for the killing of journalists. With only three exceptions these have all been for homicide. Some cases have taken six to seven years to reach court, e.g. the killings of Dmitry Kholodov and Igor Domnikov, but most deaths that have resulted in prosecution take, on average, 12–24 months between the killing and the verdict.<ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/date:2006/impunity:trial JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Trials for 2006 homicides"]</ref><ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/date:2007/impunity:trial JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Trials for 2007 deaths"]</ref>

Rates of conviction are a different matter. When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rises sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%). The Politkovskaya murder trial, which was held before a jury, ended in February 2009 with the acquittal of all those accused.

==Concern abroad==
Over the past decade the Russian authorities have been repeatedly urged, by Western governments and international media bodies, to do more to investigate the deaths of journalists there. The Paris-based [[Reporters Without Borders]] constantly criticized Russia for what it described as a failure to investigate these murders<ref>http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=30218</ref><ref>http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=18803</ref><ref name=round-up>[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=20286 "Three journalists were killed in Russia, making 21 since President Putin came to power in March 2000. Pressed by democratic countries to find and punish the culprits, the government has assigned a team of 150 detectives to the case", Press Freedom Round-up 2006], Reporters without Borders, 31 December 2006.</ref><ref name=round-up/><ref>[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article%3D18803 "Anna Politkovskaya: Reporter for the independent biweekly Novaya Gazeta, murdered in Moscow on 7 October"], Reporters without Borders, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/2008/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article%3D18803 Press releases about Anna Politkovskaya, 2007 and 2008], Reporters without Borders, September 2008.
</ref>
.<ref>[http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/rapport_en_europe.pdf EUROPE AND THE FORMER SOVIET BLOC, 2008 annual report] Reporters without Borders: Paris, April 2008</ref> The organization further claimed that many of the dead journalists had been critical of the Russian President, [[Vladimir Putin]]. Between March 2000 and July 2007, said Reporters Without Borders, 21 journalists were murdered in Russia because of their work.<ref>[http://www.rsf.org/After-Russia-awarded-2014-Winter.html "After Russia awarded 2014 Winter Olympics, authorities should demonstrate a real will to solve murders of journalists"], [[Reporters Without Borders]], 10 July 2007.</ref>

Similar figures were produced by the CPJ.<ref>[http://cpj.org/Briefings/2005/russia_murders/russia_murders.html "Russia: Thirteen murders, no justice"], 2005 CPJ briefing (accessed 8 July 2007).</ref> In a June 2007 statement the CPJ said, "A total of 47 journalists have been killed in Russia since 1992, with the vast majority of killings unsolved,".<ref name=cpj2/> Seventeen of these journalists had been killed "in the line of duty" since 2000: 14 were murdered in retaliation for their journalism; "two died in crossfire; and one was killed while covering a dangerous assignment". The CPJ was continuing to investigate the deaths of eight other journalists to see if there was a link with their work. None of the 14 murders committed since 2000 had been solved, the CPJ said, and "13 bear the marks of contract hits".<ref name=cpj2/>

Pressure on the Russian authorities increased in late 2006 after the murder of Anna Politkovskaya. In June 2007 the board of the World Association of Newspapers passed a resolution, calling on the authorities in Russia to "investigate journalist deaths more vigorously"<ref>[http://www.wan-press.org/print.php3?id_article=14269 "World's Press calls for Justice in Murder of Russian Journalists"], World Association of Newspapers press release, 5 June 2007, dateline: Capetown, South Africa (accessed 8 July 2007).</ref>:

:The brutal murder on 7 October 2006 of ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]], known for her critical reporting on the conflict in Chechnya in which she sought to expose human rights abuses, was yet another reminder to Russian journalists that violence awaits those who investigate or criticise. It is estimated that 21 journalists have been killed since Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power in March 2000. In the great majority of cases, no one has been convicted and sentenced for the murders.

On 18 June 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 151, calling on Putin to "step-up efforts to investigate" the murders.<ref name=house>[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/06-18-2007/0004610609&EDATE= "House Passes Smith's Resolution Calling on Russia to Accept Outside Aid to Investigate Murders of Journalists", 2007] (access date 10 March 2008).</ref> In a report published in 2007, the [[International News Safety Institute]] said more journalists had died violent deaths in Russia in the previous 10 years than anywhere in the world apart from Iraq,<ref>[http://www.newssafety.org/images/pdf/KillingtheMessenger.pdf KILLING THE MESSENGER: The report on the global inquiry into the protection of journalists], International News Safety Institute, 2007.</ref> though it offered statistics rather than details of the individual victims.<ref name=house/> The website of the British [[New Statesman]] magazine, in what was described as "solidarity with the dead, and in association with [[Amnesty International]], [[Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations]], the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] and [[Index on Censorship]]" published a list of 40 Russian journalists killed since 1993, representing only some of those who died.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/russian-journalists "Russian journalism's body count"], ''[[The New Statesman]]'', undated (accessed 9 July 2009).</ref>

== Dissenting voices, legal issues ==
Immediately after Politkovskaya's murder doubts were expressed about the chances of justice being done, even though the victim in this case was a journalist who had acquired a worldwide reputation (cf. [[Dmitry Kholodov]] in 1994). American commentator [[Anne Applebaum]] thought that the murderers of Politkovskaya would never be found.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/id/2151209/ Anne Applebaum, "Anna Politkovskaya, 1958-2006: Russia's best-known journalist, murdered in Moscow"], ''Slate'' magazine, 9 October 2006 (accessed 8 July 2007).</ref> There were also some dissenting and sceptical voices.

German author [[Gabriele Krone-Schmalz]] wrote that many of the deaths of journalists could be explained by ordinary criminality. She suggested that the number of killings during Putin's presidency was no higher than under [[Boris Yeltsin]].<ref name="russland"/> Writing for the maverick ''eXile'' publication in Moscow, Kirill Pankratov accused the CPJ of applying different standards to different countries and for classifying certain suspicious deaths of Russian journalists as "confirmed" murders.<ref>[http://exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=17074&IBLOCK_ID=35 "Liars without borders", [[The eXile]], 27 February 2008].</ref> He and others noted that some of the murders had now been solved and the suspects jailed.

Recent killings, in various parts of Russia, of Ilyas Shurpayev,<ref>[http://www.radiomayak.ru/doc.html?id=87240&cid=43&cat=0 «Осуждены убийцы журналиста Ильяса Шурпаева», Radio Mayak, 30 July 2008]</ref> Yury Shebalkin,<ref>[http://www.rosbalt.ru/2008/04/09/473173.html «Осуждены убийцы калининградского журналиста», Rosbalt, 9 April 2008]</ref> Konstantin Borovko<ref name="gazeta.ru">[http://www.gazeta.ru/news/lenta/2008/02/29/n_1185956.shtml «Во Владивостоке осуждены убийцы хабаровского журналиста», gazeta.ru, 29 February 2008]</ref> and Leonid Etkind<ref>[http://www.regnum.ru/news/877343.html «В Саратове осуждены убийцы журналиста», Regnum, 29 August 2007]</ref> did indeed lead to trials and convictions. This was also true of some of the men involved in the brutal, earlier murder of 23-year old Internet journalist Vladimir Sukhomlin.<ref>[http://news.aif.ru/news.php?id=14717 «Убийцы журналиста Сухомлина осуждены на 42 года тюрьмы», news.aif.ru, 30 April 2004]</ref> Ilya Zimin's alleged killer, meanwhile, was tried in his native Moldova and acquitted.<ref>[http://www.lenta.ru/lib/14161379/ Зимин, Илья]</ref> Yet these examples do not disprove the charge of partial justice since only one of the deaths was related beyond doubt to the journalistic work of the victim.

Criticism from abroad was frequently perceived and rejected as selective. However, Russia's sought-for status as a member of [[G8]] from 1997 onwards set a benchmark that showed the continuing deaths of journalists, and of other media restrictions within the country, in an unfavourable light. Also of importance was the country's admission to the Council of Europe and, as a result, the potential involvement, after 1998, of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] as an arbiter of last resort. Unsuccessful attempts were made for the 2004 acquittal of Dmitry Kholodov's alleged killers to be examined in Strasbourg. So far the Court has only once determined the failure of the Russian authorities to pursue those responsible for the violent deaths of journalists. In 2005 it ruled that the October 1999 killing in Chechnya of cameramen Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev and of more than thirty other civilians who died during the same incident had not been properly investigated.<ref>A complaint was lodged with the Court in 2000 by the [[Memorial]] human rights organisation, on behalf of relatives of civilians who died alongside the two cameramen. See note on p. 10, [http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE] and summary on p. 57 of  [http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/0434BA79-65A5-4F74-8390-87574DD3EDE3/0/Annual_Report_2005.pdf ECHR, Annual Report 2005].</ref>

== Killing not the only or always the best measure ==

There are certain countries where, over the past two decades, killing of journalists has been a regular occurrence (e.g. Colombia, Philippines, India). There are authoritarian regimes where few if any journalists have been killed in the same period (e.g. China, Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Cuba) - journalists know their place and other forms of coercion keep them in line. Within Russia there has been regular monitoring since the late 1990s by the Glasnost Defence Foundation and the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations of all forms of intimidation or coercion used against journalists. Their evidence suggests that direct and indirect pressure on media outlets, increasingly through the courts in cases of criminal defamation, is widespread and ranges from obstruction of publishing activities, to assaults on staff and frequent threats to investigative reporters.

If approximately three quarters of the  murders of journalists over the past 16 years are probably not related to their investigations and publications, the CJES considers that up to 70% of assaults, which annually run into the dozens, are work-related. Sometimes these are very serious indeed. In November 2008 Mikhail Beketov, chief editor of the ''Khimkinskaya pravda'', a paper in a Moscow suburb, was beaten so severely that although he survived, and his paper has even resumed limited publication, by early 2010 he had still not regained the power of speech or independent movement.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18impunity.html?scp=2&sq=levy&st=nyt | title=It's Open Season on Journalists Near Moscow | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18interrogate.html?ref=europe | title=Beaten Russian Editor Is Told to Say It's His Fault | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>

==Journalists killed reporting on Chechnya==
This category overlaps with that for Russia as a whole. It highlights the link in these extreme conditions between journalism, public activism and human rights activities. In their different ways the deaths of Dmitry Krikoryants, Dmitry Kholodov, Nadezhda Chaikova, [[Viktor Popkov]],<ref>[http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/view/72 Journalists in Russia, Popkov]</ref> Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, Stanislav Markelov and Natalia Estemirova all show that the troubled situation in the small North Caucasian republic reaches well beyond its formal borders.

For all who died, or received their fatal wounds, in Chechnya see records in IFJ database.<ref>http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/federaldistrictplus:Chechnya</ref> There were those killed in locations near or far from the North Caucasian republic, e.g. Natalya Alyakina, Anna Politkovskaya, whose deaths were also a consequence of the armed conflict in Chechnya.
