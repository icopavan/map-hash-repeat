'''Tom Friendly''',<ref name = "comic con 2009"/> often referred to as '''Tom''' or '''Mr. Friendly''', is a [[Recurring character|recurring]] [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[M. C. Gainey]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) [[television series]] ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''. The series follows the lives of around forty survivors from the crash of [[Oceanic Flight 815]]. The survivors find themselves on a mysterious tropical island, and interact with a group known as the [[Others (Lost)|Others]], who appear to have lived on [[Mythology of Lost#The island|the island]] since long before the crash. Tom is an influential member of the Others, and is introduced in 2005 in the [[Lost (season 1)|season one]] finale "[[Exodus (Lost)#Part 2|Exodus: Part 2]]", where he kidnaps one of the survivors. The character makes another fifteen appearances before being killed in the [[Lost (season 3)|season three]] finale "[[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|Through the Looking Glass]]". Tom appears twice in [[Lost (season 4)|season four]] in the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s of other characters. Gainey was initially credited as playing "bearded man" and then as "Mr. Friendly" throughout season two before the character was given a first name. In a montage of deceased characters shown at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] in 2009, the ''Lost'' producers present the character's full name as "Tom Friendly".<ref name = "comic con 2009">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a167283/live-lost-panel-at-comic-con.html |title=Live: 'Lost' panel at Comic-Con |accessdate=2009-07-27 |last=Wilkes |first=Neil |date=July 25, 2009 |publisher=''[[Digital Spy]]''}}</ref>

Gainey accepted the role despite knowing nothing about it; his sole motivation was a chance to work again with ''Lost'' producer [[Carlton Cuse]]. Speculation over Tom's sexuality arose when he commented to [[Kate Austen|Kate]] that she was "not [his] type".<ref name = "A Tale of Two Cities"/> Gainey began playing the character as such, and in season four Tom is shown kissing another man on the cheek. ''Lost'' producer [[Damon Lindelof]] commented that this revelation was "not subtle, to say the least".<ref name="PodcastMar08"/> Tom was received positively by critics, particularly in his first appearance.
