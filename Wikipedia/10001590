{{see also|Governorship of Mitt Romney#Abortion}}

In a Carmen piece in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' on July 26, 2005, Romney stated: "I am pro-life. I believe that abortion is the wrong choice except in cases of incest, rape, and to save the life of the mother. I wish the people of America agreed, and that the laws of our nation could reflect that view. But while the nation remains so divided over abortion, I believe that the states, through the democratic process, should determine their own abortion laws and not have them dictated by judicial mandate."<ref name="Veto-Contraception">{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/07/26/why_i_vetoed_contraception_bill/ |title=Why I vetoed contraception bill |last=Romney |first=Mitt |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2005-07-25 |accessdate=2006-11-21}}

During his 2007–2008 run for president, Romney declared that he thinks [[abortion]] should be illegal except in cases of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is threatened.<ref name="Veto-Contraception" /> He criticized the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]].''<ref name="Veto-Contraception" />
Romney's spokesperson has indicated that had Romney been the [[governor of South Dakota]], he would have signed into law the [[Women's Health and Human Life Protection Act|controversial law banning abortion]], but he would include exceptions for cases of incest or rape, which the South Dakota law excludes.<ref>

When Romney ran against Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in 1994, his advisor Charles Manning told the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' that there were only "tiny nuances" of difference between Kennedy's and Romney's views on abortion.<ref name="nuances1">

In a 1994 debate with Senator Kennedy, Romney said that abortion should be legal, declaring that "regardless of one's beliefs about choice, you would hope it would be safe and legal."<ref name="On Abortion">

Romney said in a debate with Kennedy, in response to the question "If abortion is morally wrong, aren't you responsible for discouraging it?"
<blockquote>
One of the great things about our nation . . . is that we're each entitled to have strong personal beliefs, and we encourage other people to do the same.  But as a nation, we recognize the right of all people to believe as they want and not to impose our beliefs on other people.  I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. I have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a US Senate candidate.  I believe that since ''Roe v. Wade'' has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it, and I sustain and support that law, and the right of a woman to make that choice, and my personal beliefs, like the personal beliefs of other people, should not be brought into a political campaign."<ref name="kennedydebate">
{{YouTube|id=a9IJUkYUbvI|title=The Real Romney?}}
</ref>
</blockquote>

When Kennedy then accused him of being "multiple-choice," Romney replied:
<blockquote>"On the accusation of being 'multiple-choice', I have to respond.  I have my own beliefs, and those beliefs are very dear to me. One of them is that I do not impose my beliefs on other people.  Many, many years ago, I had a dear, close family relative that was very close to me who passed away from an illegal abortion.  It is since that time my mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. And you will not see me wavering on that, or being multiple-choice, thank you very much."<ref name="kennedydebate"/>
</blockquote>

The person Romney was referring to was a teenage girl engaged to marry a member of Romney's extended family. Romney's sister Jane has said that the girl's death changed the family's perspective on the legality of abortion.<ref name="Globe_Ebbert_abortion_stance"/>

Thus, Romney maintains that he has always followed his Church teachings and has been personally [[pro-life]].

When he was considering a run for office in Utah, Romney reportedly told a newspaper in Salt Lake City that he did not want to be classified as a "pro-choice" politician.<ref name="On Abortion"/>

During the [[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2002|2002 governor's race]], Romney's platform stated, "As Governor, Mitt Romney would protect the current pro-choice status quo in Massachusetts. No law would change. The choice to have an abortion is a deeply personal one. Women should be free to choose based on their own beliefs, not the government's."<ref name=" MITT ROMNEY ON THE ISSUES">

Romney has said his views on abortion were drastically altered on November 9, 2004 after discussing stem cell research with Douglas Melton, a stem cell researcher at [[Harvard University]]. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute was planning research that would have involved therapeutic cloning.<ref name="Romney's choice">

Melton disputes Romney's account of the meeting, declaring "Governor Romney has mischaracterized my position; we didn't discuss killing or anything related to it . . .

In a press conference video in May 2005 however, Romney when asked about Massachusetts abortion laws said "I have indicated that as governor, I am absolutely committed to my promise to maintain the status quo with regards to laws relating to abortion and choice, and so far I've been able to successfully do that," indicating that the governor continued to hold a pro-choice position post-November 2004.<ref>

On January 29, 2007, in a visit to South Carolina, Romney stated, "Over the last multiple years, as you know, I have been effectively pro-choice, I never called myself that as a label but I was effectively pro-choice and that followed a personal experience in my extended family that led to that conclusion." Romney continued saying every decision he made as governor, "in a very liberal state has been on the side of favoring life, I am firmly pro-life."<ref>

Romney declined to sign a pro-life pledge for 2012 presidential candidates sponsored by the [[Susan B.

The pledge also commits signers to nominate judges and appoint executive branch officials who are pro-life. Romney's spokeswoman said the pledge could have "unforeseen consequences" and that Romney could not "in good conscience sign it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57256.html |title=Romney won't sign abortion pledge |publisher=Politico.com |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

As [[Governor of Massachusetts]], Romney announced plans to file a [[death penalty]] bill in early 2005.  The bill, filed April 28, 2005, sought to reinstate the death penalty in cases that include [[terrorism]], the assassination of law enforcement officials and multiple killings. Romney's legislation required the presence of scientific evidence such as [[DNA]] to sentence someone to death and a tougher standard of "no doubt" of guilt for juries to sentence defendants. This differs from the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard used in traditional criminal cases. The legislation called for a pool of certified capital case lawyers to ensure proper representation for the accused and allowed jurors who do not personally support the death penalty to serve in the guilt phase of the trial.<ref>{{cite news | author =

===Education===
Romney supports increasing standards for education and quality based incentives for teachers. He proposes identifying failing schools, more efficient schools   and accountability, school choice, and English immersion.

<blockquote>
I've taken a position where, once upon a time, I said I wanted to eliminate the Department of Education. That was my position when I ran for Senate in 1994. That's very popular with the base.

Romney was against reviving the [[Fairness Doctrine]], which required broadcasters to devote some of their airtime to discussing controversial matters of public interest, and to air contrasting views regarding those matters.  Romney said, "I'd veto it if it ever got to my desk. And I would fight against it vehemently.

For Romney's 1994 US Senate campaign, he supported the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on gun sales, and a ban on particular semi-automatic rifles.<ref name="romneynra"/>

As governor, Romney signed a 2004 measure instituting a permanent Massachusetts ban on [[assault weapon|military style assault weapons]], to take the place of a Federal ban, which was then about to expire.  The bill made Massachusetts the first state to enact its own such ban on specific semi-automatic weapons and some shotguns with specific accessories, and Romney supported the law with the comment: "These guns are not made for recreation or self-defense. They are instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people."<ref>

Romney later clarified that he did not 'own' a gun and said that one of his sons keeps two guns at the family vacation home in Utah.<ref name="LeBlanc"/>

The Associated Press reported in April 2007 that Romney never sought a hunting license in any of the four states where he has resided.  Romney replied by saying that he mainly hunts [[small game]] in Utah, which does not require a license.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/07/AR2007040701089.html|title=Four States Report Romney Never Got Hunting Licenses|work=The Washington Post | agency = Associated Press|date=April 8, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-08 | first=Glen | last=Johnson}}</ref>

===LGBT issues===
Prior to Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, he had a varied history regarding legal rights and responsibilities accorded to [[same-sex couples]]. During his 1994 senate campaign and 2002 Massachusetts gubernatorial campaign, Romney said he would have a better policy providing for domestic partnerships than his Democratic opponents.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://nymag.com/news/politics/powergrid/27841/ | title = The Right Man | work = New York | author = John Heilemann | date = February 11, 2007 | accessdate = June 21, 2007}}</ref>
In 1994, Romney sent a letter to the [[Log Cabin Republicans]] saying that he would be a stronger advocate for gay rights in the Senate than his opponent at the time, Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]]. His letter included the phrase "We must make equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern."<ref name="NYTimes gay rights">

In 1994, Romney supported the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]], but by 2006 he had changed his mind and opposed it because it would "unfairly penalize employers at the hands of activist judges."<ref>Signorile, Michelangelo.

====Don't ask, don't tell====
Romney supported Bill Clinton's "[[Don't ask, don't tell]]" policy in 1994, and continued to do so in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/08/us/politics/08romney.html |title=Romney's Tone on Gay Rights Is Seen as Shift|author=Michael Luo|work=The New York Times|date=2007-09-08|accessdate=2007-11-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/18/AR2007021801218.html | title=Romney Supports 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' | author=John Solomon | work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-02-19 | accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref>
Romney said in 2007 that he thinks that the "Don't ask, don't tell" policy is working and he would not change it, especially in the middle of a war, and that "we have much bigger issues as a nation that we ought to be talking about than that policy right now."<ref name="NH Debate"/>

In December, 2011, however, Romney told the Des Moines Register that now that the "Don't ask, don't tell" policy has been repealed, "I’m not planning on reversing that at this stage. I was not comfortable making the change during a period of conflict, due to the complicating features of a new program in the middle of two wars going on, but those wars are winding down, and moving in that direction at this stage no longer presents that problem.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/12/12/Mitt_Romney_Now_Supports_Gays_in_the_Military/ |title=Mitt Romney now supports gays in military? |work=Advocate.com |date=2011-12-12 |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>

====Gay marriage====
{{see also|Governorship of Mitt Romney#Same-sex marriage}}
Romney has stated his support for traditional marriage and opposition to both [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]], though he supports some domestic partnership benefits and (at the state level) supports anti-discrimination laws to protect gays and lesbians in the workplace.

As a candidate for governor in 2002, Romney said: "Call me old fashioned, but I don't support gay marriage nor do I support civil union." During that 2002 campaign, he also supported hate crimes legislation and opposed other discrimination against gays, while supporting some partner benefits for gays.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Also in 2002, Romney opposed a Massachusetts constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships because the amendment, which was supported by the Democratic leader [[Tom Finneran]], would have prohibited domestic partnership benefits for gays and lesbians.<ref name=bay>
[http://www.baywindows.com/index.php?ch=columnists&sc=theromneyfiles&sc2=&sc3=&id=53677 "Don't dismiss Romney, gay Republicans say"] ''Bay Windows'' Laura Kiritsy, October 24, 2002</ref>
Romney said, <blockquote>"Basically I see the provision of basic civil rights and domestic partnership benefits [as] a campaign against Tom Finneran. I see Tom Finneran and the Democratic leadership as having opposed the application of domestic partnership benefits to gay and lesbian couples and I will support and endorse efforts to provide those domestic partnership benefits to gay and lesbian couples."<ref name=bay/>
</blockquote>  

In November 2003, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[Massachusetts State Constitution]] requires that same-sex marriage be permitted under law; in response this time, Governor Romney supported a state constitutional amendment to forbid such marriages.<ref name="tumulty"/>

In 2006, Romney announced his support of the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would have federally defined marriage in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] as the union of one man and one woman.<ref>

Romney said during his 2008 presidential campaign,
<blockquote>
[M]y view on marriage has been entirely consistent over my political career. And that is that I oppose same-sex marriage. I also oppose civil unions . . . ever since [same-sex marriage] became a prominent [feature] in my state, with the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court, I have taken every action that I could conceive of within the bounds of the law to defend traditional marriage and to stop same-sex marriage . . . I've been to Washington to testify in favor of traditional marriage. I've written a letter to every U.S. senator on the topic . . . I believe that traditional marriage is right for the nurturing and development of children, but that I do not want to discriminate against gay people in employment or housing or other parts of their life.<ref name="humanevents1">

===Illegal drugs===
Romney is an opponent of illegal drugs and does not favor legalizing [[medical cannabis]].  Romney answered a question on the subject from a man afflicted with [[muscular dystrophy]] who asked him about it on October 7, 2007.  The man stated that he is medically dependent on medicinal marijuana, and asked if Romney would have him and his doctors arrested.  Romney did not answer the question directly, but repeated his stance on medical marijuana, and walked away. <ref>{{cite news

===Pornography===
Romney has criticized what he calls the "cesspool" of [[pornography]]; however, in July 2007, [[Tony Perkins (politician)|Tony Perkins]] of the [[Family Research Council]], the president of the [[American Family Foundation]], and Daniel Weiss, media analyst for [[James Dobson]]'s [[Focus on the Family]] said Romney had not prevented [[Marriott Hotels]] from making pornography available in its hotel rooms when he served on the hotel chain's board from 1992 to 2001.  In an Associated Press interview, Romney said he was unaware of how much revenue the hotels generated from pornography, although he had served on the board's financial audit committee.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wnbc.com/politics/13629915/detail.html |title=Conservatives Link Romney, Pornography |work=WNBC |date=2007-07-02}}</ref>

===Privacy===
Romney has stated that allowing [[contraception]] has worked for the states and he saw no reason to change that, but he has declined to state whether the states should have the power to ban it if they wish.<ref name="foggy">{{Citation| last = Abcarian| first = Robin| title = GOP debate: Mitt Romney grows foggy on contraception| newspaper = Los Angeles Times| year = 2012| date = January 7, 2012| url = http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-mitt-romney-grows-foggy-on-contraception-question-20120107,0,3685593.story| accessdate = 2012-01-15}}</ref> The question arose from Romney's opposition to ''Roe v.

==Economic policy==
In January 2008, a comprehensive analysis by the [[National Taxpayers Union]] found that Romney's presidential campaign proposals would increase the [[Federal budget (United States)|federal budget]] by $19.5 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntu.org/main/press.php?PressID=991&org_name=NTUF |title=Study: Presidential Frontrunners Would Boost Federal Budget by Range of $7 Billion to $287 Billion Annually |publisher=Ntu.org |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>  Some of Romney's economic policy advisors are [[R.

===Stimulus===
In January 2009, Romney said:
<blockquote> I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time. And that's one of the reasons why I think a stimulus program is needed.<ref>{{cite web| title = CNN LATE EDITION WITH WOLF BLITZER| publisher = [[CNN]]| date = January 4, 2009

Romney said, however, that he did not support the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]].

In 2011, Romney reversed himself and repeated the charge after denying that he had ever said that Obama's actions had made the recession worse.<ref>Daly, Corbett B.

===Housing market===
In 2011, Romney said that
<blockquote>
"As to what to do for the housing industry specifically, and are there things you can do to encourage housing? One is, don't try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom. Allow investors to buy homes, put renters in them, fix the homes up, and let it turn around and come back up. The Obama administration has slow walked the foreclosure processes that have long existed, and as a result we still have a foreclosure overhang. Number two, the credit (that) was given to first time homebuyers was insufficient and inadequate to turn around the housing market. I think it was an ineffective idea. It was a little bit like the cash-for-clunkers program, throwing government money at something which was not market oriented, did not staunch the decline in home values anymore than it encouraged the auto industry to take off. I think the idea of helping people refinance homes to stay in them is one that's worth further consideration. But I'm not signing on until I find out who's going to pay and who's going to get bailed out, and that's not something which we know all the answers to."<ref>[http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/01/democratic-national-committee/ad-claims-mitt-romneys-housing-policy-let-foreclos/ An ad claims Mitt Romney's housing policy is to let foreclosures "hit the bottom."]</ref></blockquote>

Mitt Romney supported a rescue of the auto-industry with government backed loan guarantees and warranty guarantees, preferring the corporations go through a managed restructuring process.<ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Grier |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2011/0603/Was-the-auto-bailout-Mitt-Romney-s-idea |title=Was the auto bailout Mitt Romney's idea? |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Mitt Romney |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html |title=Let Detroit Go Bankrupt |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-11-18}}</ref>

Romney opposed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] during the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis]].

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney (R) has been critical of former Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D) and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union on Thursday as he took his presidential campaign to his native Michigan. "They're out there working very hard for their friend, Barack Obama," he added. "I think the union folks basically bought and paid for his last campaign, so he's taking care of them and they're taking care of him."<ref>{{cite news|last=O'Brien |first=Michael |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/165575-romney-in-detroit-lashes-out-at-granholm-autoworkers-union |title=During Detroit visit, Romney lashes out at powerful autoworkers' union |publisher=Thehill.com |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

===Campaign finance===
In 2007 Romney began criticizing the [[McCain-Feingold Law]], saying "We step into dangerous territory when politicians start eviscerating our fundamental freedoms in the name of amorphous principles, like campaign finance reform."<ref name="Campaign-finance">

</ref>
In his 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Romney proposed taxing private political contributions in order to finance publicly funded campaigns.<ref name="Campaign-finance"/>
In his 1994 Senate campaign, Romney advocated spending limits on congressional campaigns and suggested abolishing [[political action committee]]s.<ref name="Campaign-finance"/>
Romney has not given up on campaign finance, but says that McCain-Feingold does not work. He said; "The original intent of McCain-Feingold was to reduce the role of money and special interests in our political system. But on this too it has been a failure. Political spending has been driven into secret corners and more power and influence has been handed to hidden special interests. What is really needed is greater transparency, and disclosure, of campaign contributions – not more restrictions on political speech."

===Trade===
Romney has campaigned in support of free and fair trade and has said that America must act quickly to ensure trade and commerce, which will further strengthen and grow its own economy.  He states that if America fails to act quickly, their economy will be eclipsed by these growing nations.<ref>

Romney supports getting tougher with China on trade issues and has pushed to renegotiate trade deals with China to help eliminate the [[Trade Deficit]]. Romney opposes currency manipulation by China and is willing to impose tariffs when necessary.<ref name="ontheissues.org"/>

Romney was against imposing sanctions on China for trade abuses in 2011 and for doing so in 2012.<ref>Koff, Stephen.

===Minimum wage===
Governor Romney has said that he favors "moderate, predictable changes" in the [[minimum wage]] linked to other indicators of growth in the economy. "I don't like the big jumps from time to time."<ref name=romneyreligion>

===Unemployment insurance===
In 2010, Romney said that
<blockquote>
"A decent and humane society must have a strong safety net for the unemployed. I served for 15 years as a lay pastor in my church and saw the heartbreak of joblessness up close; a shattering loss of faith in oneself is but only one of many forms the suffering can take. Nonetheless, the vital necessity of providing for those without work should not be used as an excuse to ignore the very real problems of our unemployment system. In this, as in so many other arenas of government policy, unemployment insurance has many unintended effects.
<br>
The indisputable fact is that unemployment benefits, despite a web of regulations, actually serve to discourage some individuals from taking jobs, especially when the benefits extend across years.
<br>
The system is also not designed for a flexible economy like ours in which some employees move from job to job for short periods, and are therefore ineligible for unemployment compensation when they are faced with a protracted spell without work."<ref name="usa-btc"/>
</blockquote>
Romney instead offered two possible replacement systems, one involving individual unemployment savings accounts that employees would withdraw from when they lose their jobs, the other keyed on instituting financial incentives for businesses and other employers to hire and train those who had been unemployed for a long time.<ref name="usa-btc"/>

===Taxation===
In 2007, Romney signed the anti-tax pledge put forth by [[Americans for Tax Reform]], pledging no new taxes or increases of existing taxes; in 2002, Romney refused to sign an anti-tax pledge because he considered them "government by gimmickry."<ref name="tax pledge">

===Energy===
{{Expand section|date=June 2011}}
Romney supports increased energy production and oil drilling in the U.S. He wants the U.S. to become independent of foreign sources of [[Petroleum|oil]], and believes that the way to do that is a combination of developing alternative sources of energy such as [[biodiesel]], [[ethanol]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], and [[Clean coal technology|coal]] gasification, and finding more domestic sources of oil such as in [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR) and the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].<ref>[http://www.mittromney.com/Issue-Watch/Energy Issues - Energy Issues] MittRomney.com</ref>

<blockquote>
"We're using too much oil," Romney said. "We have an answer. We can use alternative sources of energy -- biodiesel, ethanol, nuclear power -- and we can drill for more oil here. We can be more energy independent and we can be far more efficient in the use of that energy."<ref>''[[Waterloo Courier]]'', September 29, 2006</ref>
</blockquote>

Romney has not formally published his proposals regarding [[Energy policy of the United States|energy policy]], but his 2008 presidential campaign website included a 2-minute video of his response to a question about his [[energy policy]] position.<ref>[http://www.mittromney.com/Issue-Watch/Energy ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

He would consider [[cap-and-trade]] only if part of a larger global plan.  He has not offered specific targets on energy efficiency.  He does not support mileage goals as a stand-alone measure, but has indicated he would consider them only if they were part of a comprehensive energy plan. He supports [[nuclear power]] as part of an energy mix.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1680173,00.html Kluger, Jeffrey; "The Eco Vote"; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine; November 2, 2007.]</ref>

Romney has supported a $20 billion package for energy research & new car technology.

Romney opposes [[Cap and Trade]] and opposes regulating carbon emissions.  In July 2011, while speaking in Derry, New Hampshire, Romney stated that he mostly supports the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s mission, but he does not think it should regulate [[carbon footprint|carbon emissions]]. Romney said "We have made a mistake...in saying that the EPA should regulate carbon emissions" and "I don’t think carbon is a pollutant in the sense of harming our bodies".<ref>{{cite web

Romney, as Governor of Massachusetts, initially supported regulation of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, primarily through voluntary measures, but eventually rejected it. He issued a 72-point Climate Protection Plan. His staffers spent more than $500,000 negotiating the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI—pronounced "Reggie"), which Romney praised in November 2005, saying "I'm convinced it is good business." As plan details were being worked out, Romney began pushing for a cap on fees charged to businesses who exceed emission limits, citing concerns of increased consumer energy costs. He stated: "New England has the highest energy rates in the country, and RGGI would cost us more." This ongoing disagreement eventually led Romney, in December 2005, to pull out of RGGI. 

In his March 2010 book, ''[[No Apology: The Case for American Greatness]]'', Romney wrote, "I believe that climate change is occurring. [...] I also believe that human activity is a contributing factor. I am uncertain how much of the warming, however, is attributable to man and how much is attributable to factors out of our control."<ref name="cbs-cc"/>

In June 2011, Romney stated in New Hampshire he did, "I don't speak for the scientific community, of course, but I believe the world's getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what I read that the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know that there have been periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing."<ref name="cnn-cc">{{cite news

Speaking at the [[Consol Energy Center]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in October 2011, Romney said, "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet.

Questioned in that month about these series of written and spoken words, a Romney spokesperson said that "Governor Romney has been consistent in his statements on global warming."<ref name="cbs-cc"/>

Romney has further elucidated that U.S. action on climate change must be seen in a global context: "By the way, they do not call it America warming, they call it global warming. [U.S. action] loses jobs for Americans and ultimately it won't be successful, because industries that are energy intensive will just get up and go somewhere else."<ref name="cbs-cc"/> 

In 2003, Romney appointed environmental advocate [[Douglas I. Foy]] (former president of the [[Conservation Law Foundation]]) to head the state development office. Foy resigned in February 2006 after Romney announced he would not seek re-election.

The advisory council is led by co-chairmen [[Tom Price (US politician)|Tom Price]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] congressman, and Tim Murphy, currently president of [[Beacon Health Strategies]] and formally Romney's secretary of health and humane services in [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2007/08/mitt_romney_tod.html |title=Romney announces healthcare advisers |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2007-08-22 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>  The four other members are Georgia [[Phil Gingrey|Congressman Phil Gingrey]], domestic policy expert [[John Cogan]], [[Columbia Business School]] [[Glenn Hubbard (economics)|Dean Glenn Hubbard]], and Romney aide [[Cindy Gillespie]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/08/first_romneys_health_care_poli.php |title=First: Romney's Health Care Policy Advisory List |work=The Atlantic |date=2007-08-22 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref>

On August 24, 2007, Romney unveiled his national health care plan.  His plan allowed the states to choose individual health care plans for their fellow Americans.<ref>[http://blogs.usatoday.com/onpolitics/2007/08/romney-vision-f.html 'Romney vision for health care reform' now online]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>

He opposes efforts to provide non-emergency health coverage for Illegal Immigrants, and supports the [[Hyde Amendment]] to ban government funding for elective abortion.<ref name="ontheissues.org"/>

As of 2009, Romney supports increased health insurance portability, coverage of pre-existing medical conditions, a cap on malpractice lawsuits, the implementation of a streamlined [[electronic medical records]] system, an emphasis on preventative care, loosening restrictions on importation of prescription drugs, and tax benefits aimed at making health insurance more affordable for the uninsured and targeted to promote universal access. Romney opposes a federal government run, single-payer system, but supports state efforts to reduce the uninsured population.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,557283,00.html |title=Governor Bobby Jindal Discusses Health Care Reform He Wants to See - Neil Cavuto | Your World |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}</ref>

Romney opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], also known by "Obamacare" and similar names.<ref name=cnn_mitt/>  Immediately following the March 2010 passage of it and it being signed by President [[Barack Obama]], Romney attacked the landmark legislation as "an unconscionable abuse of power".<ref name=cnn_mitt>{{Cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/03/22/romney-on-health-vote-obama-betrayed-his-oath-to-the-nation/?fbid=hihd0TEQQJG|title=Romney on health vote: Obama 'betrayed his oath to the nation'|publisher=CNN | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="ap032610">{{Cite news| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700019894/Romneycare-may-come-back-to-haunt-Mitt-on-health-issue.html | title=Romneycare may come back to haunt Mitt on health issue | author=Johnson, Glen | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[Deseret News]] | location=Salt Lake City | date=March 26, 2010}}</ref> He said, "The act should be repealed.

In 2011, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a Republican alternative budget proposed by [[Paul Ryan]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Wisconsin|Wisc.]]), with no Democrats voting for it.  One controversial aspect of the proposal concerned [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]; it would replace government-provided health care with partial subsidies for the cost of private medical insurance.  Romney said that, as President, he would sign such a plan if it reached his desk, but that he would be putting forward his own plan before debating Obama.<ref>{{cite news| last = Friedman| first = Emily| title = Romney Talks to ABC News About Health Care, Jobs, Ties and Red Sox | publisher = [[ABC News]]| date = June 2, 2011 | url = http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenote/2011/06/romney-talks-to-abc-news-about-health-care-jobs-ties-and-red-sox.html | accessdate = 2011-06-03}}</ref> In addition Romney would also raise the minimum age for Medicare eligibility, to minimize government expenditures for health care.<ref>Hunt, Kasie.

===Technology===
Romney believes the government should invest more in technologies that will help the United States, such as [[power generation]], [[fuel cells]], [[nanotechnology]], and [[materials science]].
<blockquote>
"In technology, we as a country already invest an enormous amount--for instance, in defense technology, space technology, health--but we also need to invest in some of the emerging technologies that are important at a basic science level such as fuel cell technology, power generation, materials science, automotive technology. We have to recognize that where we invest as a nation, both from a government standpoint but also from a private standpoint, those are the areas we've been most successful."<ref>

</blockquote>
During his 2007 Iowa Republican Straw Poll speech, Romney advocated that all home computers provide a means for parents to block objectionable Internet content from being shown to children.
<blockquote>
". . . I want to clean up the dirty water in which a lot of our kids are swimming, and by that I'm not just talking about pollution, I'm talking about moral pollution. I'm talking about what they see on TV and on the Internet. I'm concerned about the drug culture, I'm concerned about the pornography, the violence, the sex, the perversions that they see day in and day out. I want to make sure that every computer that goes into a home in the future, has a button there, or a place for the citizen, the parent, to be able to block all of that pornography from their kids Internet screen."<ref name="c-spanarchives.org"/>

In his 2010 book, ''[[No Apology: The Case for American Greatness]]'', Romney states that one of government's useful roles is in fostering innovation.<ref name="bg-sum">{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/03/02/mitt_romneys_no_apology_is_not_light_reading/?page=full |title=Mitt Romney's 'No Apology' is not light reading | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2010-06-13 | first=Sasha | last=Issenberg}}</ref>

===Regulation of financial industry===

Romney has called for repeal of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], which was enacted in 2010.<ref name="somanader">{{cite web | last = Somanader | first = Tanya | title = Romney: I'd Like To Repeal Wall Street Reform | publisher = [[ThinkProgress]]| date = August 25, 2011 | url = http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/08/25/303967/romney-dodd-frank-repeal/ |accessdate =2011-08-25 }}</ref> The Act implemented [[Wall Street reform]] with goals that included "improving accountability and transparency in the financial system" and protecting consumers. Romney criticized the Act as being "overwhelming" in length, but he said that one provision, distinguishing between home mortgages and high-risk securities in terms of the capital requirements, "does make sense."<ref name="somanader"/>

===Space exploration===
Romney said before committing to a particular space program, he will take advice from experts in the field. He expressed doubts of a [[Colonization of the Moon|moonbase]] if the costs are on the order of  $ 500 Billions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.yahoo.com/lunar-foe-romney-endorsement-lunar-supporters-contradiction-214300822.html | title=Lunar Base Foe Romney Endorsement by Lunar Base Supporters a Contradiction | publisher=Yahoo news | date=January 28, 2012 | author=Mark Whittington}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://mittromney.com/news/press/2012/02/ground-control-major-newt-nevada-needs-jobs-not-moon-colony | title=GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR NEWT: NEVADA NEEDS JOBS, NOT MOON COLONY | publisher=Mitt Romney Press | date=February 2, 2012}}</ref>He received the endorsement of [[Michael D.

On the other hand, ''[[The Economist]]'' found that, aside from rhetoric, Romney's stated foreign policy positions offer in many instances broad continuity with those of the Obama administration.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/21532301 "Mitt Romney produces an unimaginative blueprint for America's foreign policy."] ''The Economist'', 15 October 2011.</ref> And that Obama's policies have closely followed the path set by the Bush administration.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/04/petraeus_cia "Surge superintendent to spearhead spooks."] ''The Economist'', 29 April 2011.</ref>

Romney criticized at the time [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] for saying that in his first year as president, he would meet with the leaders of several nations hostile to the government of the United States, including [[Syria]], [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], and [[Iran]].
Stating an opposing viewpoint Romney said, "Having the president meet with the authoritarian tyrants of the world is remarkably poor judgment."<ref name=romneyreligion/>

===War Powers===
In the 2008 presidential debates, Romney left open whether it was always necessary for the US Congress to issue a [[declaration of war]] before engaging in military actions. Romney stated that if he were president he would consult with his lawyers before he came to a conclusive interpretation of the [[War Powers Clause]] in the [[US Constitution]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/10/10/GOP.debate/index.html | work=CNN | title=Fireworks over taxes, war powers punctuate GOP debate - CNN.com | date=2007-10-09 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

He supports the deportation of illegal immigrants, prioritizes a secure border as well as employer verification, and opposes granting amnesty to illegal aliens.

I get that advice by talking to former generals in our military."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://us.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/28/debate.transcript.part2/index.html|title=Part II: CNN/YouTube Republican presidential debate transcript|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2007-12-02|date=November 29, 2007}}</ref>
According to [[Blackwater Worldwide|Blackwater]] expert [[Jeremy Scahill]], Romney advisor Cofer Black has been, "a key figure in the [[extraordinary rendition]] program, the government-sanctioned kidnap-and-torture program, where prisoners like [[Maher Arar]] are sent to third-country hellholes to be tortured."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/5/23/leading_gop_candidate_romney_taps_blackwaters}}</ref>

====Special Partnership Force====
That made reference to his June 21, 2007, statement that as president he would establish a Special Partnership Force to battle terrorism.
<blockquote>
"I believe America must establish a Special Partnership Force, with a core leadership drawn from Army Special Forces personnel training in working with civilian governments and Intelligence personnel. This force would work hand-in-glove with local host governments. Together, in partnership, they would seek to target and separate terrorists from the local population, and to disrupt and defeat them. They would have the authority to call in all elements of civil assistance and humanitarian aid. And, where they felt it was necessary, they could call in Delta and SEAL resources. Their goal is to build national institutions of stability and freedom, and to promote the rule of law and human rights."<ref>

===Iran===
In a June 2007 New Hampshire Republican debate, Romney was asked if he agreed "that the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, potentially, would be possible if that were the only way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb?"  Governor Romney responded that "You don't take options off the table, but what you do is stand back and say, 'What's going on here?'  You see what's happening in Sudan and Afghanistan, in Iraq and Iran.  All over the world, we're seeing the same thing happening, and that is people are testing the United States of America. And we have to make sure they understand that we're not arrogant; we have resolve. And we have the strength to protect our interests and to protect people who love liberty."<ref name="NH Debate">

Romney does not believe that the US is unable to deal with the Iranian military. He would not use ground forces for a possible eventual attack on Iran but instead would use "blockade, bombardment and surgical military strikes" for the purpose. Romney also said he would not shrink the uses of the military force especially when serious threats confront the US. As an alternative Romney seeks to get the Congress involved according to the law and the Constitution. He also believes that the Iranians are an intolerant and repressive regime that supports terrorism and develops nuclear weapons. Owing to this the spread of weapons throughout the world could pose a threat to all. He also believes economic sanctions against Iran should be tightened by denying Iran access to the international banking system, discouraging it from obtaining credit or purchasing by foreign currency. Romney has also supported strategic divestment from companies that support the Iranian regime's hazardous actions and believes that Iran should be diplomatically isolated with only communication channels remaining open to them. Romney also feels that Iran should work with the Muslim communities and their leaders to build a lasting relationship and partnership for progress and prosperity.

Prior to the opening of the 62nd session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2007 where Iran's president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was scheduled to speak, he released a letter to the Secretary-General stating that the invitation should be revoked and he should instead be greeted with an indictment under the [[Genocide Convention]] for threats against [[Israel]], and that failure to act should lead the United States to reconsider its level of support and funding for the United Nations.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/UN_Letter|date=September 17, 2007|title=Governor Romney Urges United Nations To Revoke Any Invitation To President Ahmadinejad|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>  A spokesman of the Secretary-General explained that General Assembly matters are not under his control.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.un.org//News/briefings/docs/2007/db070917.doc.htm|title=Spokesperson's Noon Briefing|date=September 17, 2007|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

In 2011, Romney advocated both overt and covert means to get Iran to stop [[Nuclear program of Iran|its nuclear weapons development program]].<ref name="jpost-il"/>  He said that “Ultimately, regime change is what’s going to be necessary.”<ref name="jpost-il"/>

===Iraq War===
Romney supported the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]<ref>{{cite news| first=Amy| last=Lorentzen| title= Romney:U.S. is angry about Iraq|date=July 27, 2007 | agency= Associated Press | work=Chron.com | url=http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/Romney-U-S-anger-over-Iraq-won-t-put-Dem-in-1811263.php | accessdate = 2011-09-18 }}</ref> and the "[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge]]". He however has criticized mismanagement of Iraq post invasion. He has stated that both diplomatic and military efforts should be used to achieve success in the region.<ref name="ontheissues.org"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/Iraq_Statement_1_10_07 |title=Press release from official Mitt Romney website |publisher=Mittromney.com |accessdate=2011-11-04}}</ref> Upon hearing the [[Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq|testimony]] of [[David Petraeus]], Romney reemphasized his agreement with current policy in Iraq and has called for a "Surge of Support" for the military. Romney has expressed support for an eventual reduction in military presence in Iraq but has strongly opposed a timetable for withdrawal.

In his speech announcing that he would run for president, Romney said, "so long as there is a reasonable prospect of success, our wisest course is to seek stability in Iraq, with additional troops endeavoring to secure the civilian population."<ref name="Presidential Announcement">
{{cite news|url=http://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/Presidential_Announcement_Remarks |date=February 13, 2007 |accessdate=2007-02-15 |title=Governor Mitt Romney's Presidential Announcement}}
</ref>
He argued that instability in Iraq could lead to civil war and that "Iraq's Sunni region could become a base for al-Qaeda; that its Shia region could be seized by Iran; that Kurd tension could destabilize Turkey; and even that the broader Middle East could be drawn into conflict."<ref name="Presidential Announcement"/>
He says that this "could mean a future with far more military involvement and far more loss of American life."<ref name="Presidential Announcement"/>
Romney said that he was willing to break with the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s policy on Iraq as other Republicans have now done, presumably if the troop surge did not prove successful, though he said it is still too early to gauge its success.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In the June 5 Republican presidential debate, Romney said that the war could have been avoided if [[Saddam Hussein]] had allowed [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] inspectors into the country. However, ''[[Media Matters]]'' pointed out that Hussein did in fact allow UN weapons inspectors into Iraq, and they found "no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons programme in Iraq."<ref name="gaffeNH">

</ref>

CNN analyst [[Paul Begala]] said Romney's misstatement would disqualify him if it had occurred in a general election debate, and it was akin to saying "the Mexicans bombed Pearl Harbor."<ref name="gaffeNH"/>
Romney's full statement was:
<blockquote>
"Well, the question is kind of a non sequitur, if you will. And what I mean by that -- or a null set -- and that is that if you're saying, let's turn back the clock and Saddam Hussein had opened up his country to IAEA inspectors and they'd come in and they'd found that there were no weapons of mass destruction -- had Saddam Hussein therefore not violated United Nations resolutions -- we wouldn't be in the conflict we're in. But he didn't do those things, and we knew what we knew at the point we made the decision to get in."<ref name="gaffeNH"/>
</blockquote>

In October 2011, Romney criticized the Obama administration's announcement that all American combat troops had been withdrawn from Iraq.<ref name="eager">{{Citation| last = Landler | first = Mark| author-link = Mark Landler| last2 = Cooper| first2 = Helene | author2-link = Helene Cooper  | title = Romney Criticizes Afghan Pullout Plan, but Obama Is Eager for the Debate| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = A16 | year = 2012| date = February 3, 2012| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/us/politics/obama-glad-to-debate-romney-on-afghanistan-pullout.html | accessdate = 2012-02-03}}</ref>

===War in Afghanistan===
Romney supported the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|War in Afghanistan]]. When asked if he agreed with the [[Bush doctrine]] regarding Afghanistan, Romney responded:

<blockquote>The president is not arrogant. The president is not subject to a bunker mentality. The president has acted out of his desire to keep America safe. And we owe him a debt of gratitude for keeping this country safe over the last six years. He did the right thing in responding and reacting to the fact that we got attacked. And people now recognize: You attack America and there is a response. But we're going to have to move our strategy from simply being a response to military threat with military action, to an effort that says we're going to use our military and nonmilitary resources, combined with other nations who are our friends, to help move the world of Islam toward modernity and moderation. The new mission for NATO is to help provide the rule of law, education that's not through madrassas, so the Muslims are able to reject the extreme and the terrorists.</blockquote>

Romney also believes that the U.S. continued presence should be decided by the military’s top brass, cautions that we should not be making similar commitments in the future. He also stressed that the bulk of the responsibility lies with the Afghanis.
 
<blockquote>I want those troops to come home based upon not politics, not based upon economics, but instead based upon the conditions on the ground determined by the generals … But I also think we have learned that our troops should not go off and try to fight a war of independence for another nation. Only the Afghanis can win Afghanistan’s independence from the Taliban.</blockquote>
  
Romney also believes that U.S. policy in Afghanistan should not be based on the economic costs alone.
 
<blockquote>There will be some who argue it’s too expensive now, we’ve got to bring the troops home right now, or others will say, politically we need to make one decision or another … You don’t make a decision about our involvement in a conflict based on dollars and cents alone or certainly not with regards to politics.</blockquote>

In 2012, when [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Leon Panetta]] outlined a plan to withdraw U.S. combat troops by 2013 if possible, Romney criticized the announcement as "misguided" and "naive".<ref>{{cite web| last = Friedman| first = Emily | title = Mitt Romney Calls Leon Panetta’s Afghanistan Withdrawal Announcement ‘Misguided’| publisher = [[ABC News]]| date = February 1, 2012| url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/02/mitt-romney-calls-leon-panettas-withdrawal-announcement-misguided/| accessdate = 2012-02-03}}</ref><ref name="eager"/>

===Syria===
Romney released the following statement concerning [[Bashar al-Assad]], the President of [[Syria]], in August 2011:

<blockquote>It has taken President Obama far too long to speak out forcefully against Assad and his vicious crackdown in Syria. In the early stages of this crisis, the Obama Administration referred to Assad as a "reformer," which had the effect of emboldening Assad and discouraging the dissidents. America must show leadership on the world stage and work to move these developing nations toward modernity. This means using the bullhorn of the presidency and not remaining silent for too long while voices of freedom and dissent are under attack.<ref>[http://foxnewsinsider.com/2011/08/18/mitt-romney-issues-statement-on-president-obamas-handling-of-syria/ Mitt Romney Issues Statement on President Obama's Handling of Syria]</ref></blockquote>

===Pakistan===
On July 7, 2007, Romney said, "In places like [[Pakistan]], America needs to work not just on a military front." He said he would send in his proposed "Special Partnership Force", a team of [[Central Intelligence Agency]] agents and Army special forces that would work with the local population to aid in military support, gun supplies, and "to help make sure that they have the rule of law, water projects, bridges built."<ref>

In 2007, Romney criticized then-candidate [[Barack Obama]] for stating that, as President, he would launch military strikes against "high-value terrorist targets" in Pakistan, even without the Pakistani government's approval.<ref>{{cite web| last = Holland| first = Steve| title = Romney attacks Obama over Pakistan warning| publisher = [[Reuters]]| date = August 4, 2007| url = http://in.reuters.com/article/2007/08/04/idINIndia-28811520070804| accessdate = 2011-12-24}}</ref>  In 2011, after such a strike resulted in the death of [[Osama bin Laden]], Romney said that, if he had been President, he would have done "exactly the same thing."<ref>{{cite web| last = Christopher| first = Tommy| title = Mitt Romney bin Busted: ‘Candidate Like Myself’ Would Have Done Bin Laden Raid (Except 2007 Mitt)| publisher = [[Mediaite]]| date = December 21, 2011| url = http://www.mediaite.com/tv/mitt-romney-bin-busted-candidate-like-myself-would-have-done-bin-laden-raid-except-2007-mitt/| accessdate = 2011-12-24}}</ref>

===Libya===
Concerning the involvement of the American military in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], Romney initially said in March that Obama had waited too long before becoming involved, and he also criticized Obama for ruling out the use of United States ground forces.<ref name="where">{{cite news | last = Tapper | first = Jake | authorlink = Jake Tapper | title = Where Is Mitt Romney on Libya? | publisher = [[ABC News]]| date = October 20, 2011| url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/where-is-mitt-romney-on-libya/| accessdate = 2011-10-22}}</ref> The next month, he said that he supported the "specific, limited mission" of enforcing a [[no-fly zone]], but that Obama's support for the ouster of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] constituted "mission creep and mission muddle."<ref name="where"/> In October, after Gaddafi's death, Romney said, "I think people across the world recognize that the world is a better place without Muammar Gaddafi."<ref name="where"/>

===Israel and the Arab-Israeli conflict===
In October 2011, during his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney said, "I believe our relationship with Israel, a nation which shares our values and is our best friend in the Middle East, should be of support and confidence rather than criticism and blame."<ref name="ihayom">Boaz Bismuth, [http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=1601 "Romney: Obama threw Israel under the bus"], ''[[Israel HaYom]]'', October 28, 2011.</ref>  In December 2011, Romney said, “I will travel to Israel on my first foreign trip [as president]. I will reaffirm as a vital national interest Israel’s existence as a Jewish state. I want the world to know that the bonds between Israel and the United States are unshakable."<ref name="jpost-il">Rebecca Anna Stoil, [http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=248582 "Republicans talk tough on Iran, vie for Jewish vote"], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', December 7, 2011.</ref>

On the question of whether the [[Embassy of the United States, Tel Aviv|U.S. Embassy in Israel in Tel Aviv]] should be moved to Jerusalem, Romney said in October 2011, "The actions that I will take will be actions recommended and supported by Israeli leaders. I don’t seek to take actions independent of what our allies think is best, and if Israel’s leaders thought that a move of that nature would be helpful to their efforts, then that’s something I’ll be inclined to do. But again, that’s a decision which I would look to the Israeli leadership to help guide. I don’t think America should play the role of the leader of the peace process, instead we should stand by our ally. Again, my inclination is to follow the guidance of our ally Israel, as to where our facilities and embassies would exist."<ref name="ihayom"/>

Regarding the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], in a January 2012 Republican debate, Romney said, "Well, the reason that there’s not peace between the Palestinians and Israel is because there is — in the leadership of the Palestinian people are Hamas and others who think like Hamas, who have as their intent the elimination of Israel. And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state."  Romney added, "There are some people who say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy  to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel."<ref>Gavriel Queenann, [http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/152171#.Ty02evlKQgU "GOP Front Runners Unite Behind Israel"], [[Arutz Sheva]], January 27, 2012.
