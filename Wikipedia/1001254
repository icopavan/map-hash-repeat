{{Fantasy}}
There are many [[Trope (literature)|elements]] that occur throughout the fantasy genre in different guises. [[Worldbuilding]], in particular, has many common conventions as do, to a lesser extent, plot, and characterization.

Many works of fantasy operate with these [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], while others use them in a [[Fictional revisionism|revisionist]] manner, making the tropes over for various reasons including; for comic effect, to create something fresh (a method that often generates new [[cliché]]s), and objections to the effects of old tropes.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Revisionist Fantasy", p 810 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

==Good vs. evil==
The conflict of good against evil is a theme in the most popular forms of fantasy, such as [[high fantasy]]; normally, evil characters erupt from their lands to invade and disrupt the good characters' lands. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] delved into the nature of good and evil in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but many of his imitators use the conflict as a [[plot device]] and often do not distinguish the sides by their actual behavior.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Good and Evil", p 422 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref> In some works, mostly notably in [[sword and sorcery]], evil is not opposed by the unambiguously good but by the morally unreliable.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Evil", p 323 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

===Hero===
{{main|Hero}}
Heroic characters are a mainstay of fantasy, particularly [[high fantasy]] and [[sword and sorcery]]. Such characters are capable of more than ordinary behavior, physically or morally, or both.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Heroes and Heroines", p 464 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref> While they may at first be less than the role required, they grow into it.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Brave Little Tailor", p 136 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref> This may take the form of maturation.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Ugly Duckling", p 972 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

Many [[protagonist]]s are, unknown even to themselves, of royal blood. Even in so fanciful a tale as ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', Alice is made a queen in the end; this can serve as a symbolic recognition of the inner worth of the hero.<ref>Stephen Prickett, ''Victorian Fantasy'' p 145-6 ISBN 0-253-17461-9</ref> Commonly, these tales revolve around the maltreated hero coming into his or her own. This can reflect a wish-fulfillment dream or symbolically embody a profound transformation.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Hidden Monarch", p 466 ISBhttp://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fantasy_tropes_and_conventions&action=editN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

===Dark Lord===<!-- This section is linked from [[The Dark Lord]] -->
The forces of evil are often personified in a "Dark Lord". He (or she) is often depicted as a diabolical force, and may be more a force than a personality. The effects of his or her rule often assert malign effects on the land as well as its subjects, as in the case of [[Jadis]] the [[White Witch]], who keeps the land of [[Narnia]] enchanted in perpetual Winter in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''. Besides usual magical abilities, the Dark Lord often controls great armies and can be portrayed as possessing devil-like qualities.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Dark Lord", p 250 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref> A Dark Lord is usually depicted as the ultimate personification of evil, often committing atrocities that make common people afraid to speak their very names, as with [[Sauron]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; the Lord of the Locusts in the ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' graphic novel series; [[Conan the Barbarian]]'s archenemy [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]]; and the [[Dark One]] (Shai'tan) of ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' and [[Lord Voldemort]] of ''[[Harry Potter]]''.

Other notable Dark Lords include the [[Sith]] Lords from ''[[Star Wars]]'', which include [[Darth Vader]] and [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Emperor]] [[Palpatine]]; Darkseid from D.C. comics. Lord [[Dracula]] of the ''[[Castlevania]]'' series; [[Skeletor]] from ''[[Masters of the Universe]]''; Brona the [[Warlock Lord]] from ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]''; [[Morgoth]] from ''[[The Silmarillion]]''; [[Arawn Death-Lord]] from ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]''; [[List of The Belgariad and The Malloreon characters#Torak|Torak]] from ''[[The Belgariad]]''; [[Nightmare (Soulcalibur)|Nightmare]] from ''[[Soul (series)|Soulcalibur]]''; the Lich King from the ''[[Warcraft]]'' franchise; [[Ganon]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''; [[Characters of Final Fantasy V#Exdeath|Exdeath]] from ''[[Final Fantasy V]]'', [[Zamorak]] from the ''[[RuneScape]]'' game and [[Galbatorix]] from ''[[The Inheritance Cycle]]''. The villain of the ''[[Demon Sword]]'' video game is also literally called 'Dark Lord'. In the ''[[Lone Wolf (gamebooks)|Lone Wolf]]'' [[gamebooks]], the ''Darklords''  are an entire race of powerful evil beings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.ncf.ca/as300/darklords.html|title=The Darklords of Helgedad|publisher=The World of Magnamund Webring|accessdate=13 July 2009}}</ref> The protagonists of the ''[[Overlord (2007 video game)|Overlord]]'' video game franchise are classic Dark Lords in the vein of Sauron.

==Quest==
{{main|Quest}}
Quests, an immemorial trope in literature, are a common trope in fantasy. They can run from a quest to locate the [[plot coupon]]s necessary to save the world, to an internal quest of self-realization.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest", p 796 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

==Magic==
{{main|Magic in fiction|Magician (fantasy)}}
In a fantasy, magic is often overwhelming in presence — although its precise nature is delineated in the book in which it appears. It can appear in a [[fantasy world]], or in a fantasy land that is part of reality but insulated from the mundane lands, or as a hidden element in real life.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Magic ", p 615-6 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

A common trope is that the ability to work magic is innate and rare. As a consequence the person who uses it, usually called a magician, wizard, sorcerer, warlock, mage, magus, or various other titles, is a common figure in fantasy.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Magic", p 616 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref> Another feature is the [[magic item]], which can endow characters with magical abilities that are not innate, or enhance the abilities of the innately powerful. Among the most common are [[magic sword]]s and [[magic ring]]s.

[[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature and arts|Self-fulfilling Prophecies]] are amongst the most common forms of magic because they are an often used [[plot device]]. Often the very effort undertaken to avert them brings them about, thus driving the story. It is very rare for a prophecy in a fantasy to be simply false, although usually their significance is clear only with hindsight. [[Quibble (plot device)|Quibble]]s can undermine the clearest appearing prophecies.<ref>John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Prophecy", p 789 ISBN 0-312-19869-8</ref>

In ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy, J. R. R. Tolkien minimized use of the word magic; beings who use such abilities tend to be confused when they are described this way by others. In the ''Star Wars'' franchise, the Jedi employ the use of [[The Force (Star Wars)|the Force]], an essentially magical power that grants mystical abilities and heightened senses and skills to whomsoever wields it.

==Medievalism==
Many creatures seen in fantasy fiction are drawn from the folklore of Europe and the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] of medieval Europe. [[Dragon]]s and [[unicorn]]s are among the most popular creatures. Other monsters, such as [[griffin]]s, [[giant (mythology)|giant]]s, and [[goblin]]s also appear. Races of intelligent beings such as [[elf|elves]] and [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] often draw their history from medieval roots. Characteristics of the hero and heroine also frequently draw on these sources as well. 

Perhaps even more important is setting. Writers from the beginnings of the fantasy genre, such as [[William Morris]] in ''[[The Well at the World's End]]'' and [[Lord Dunsany]] in ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]'', set their tales in [[fantasy world]]s clearly derived from medieval sources; though often filtered through [[Middle Ages in history|later views]]. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] set the type even more clearly for [[high fantasy]] which is normally based in such a "pseudo-medieval" setting. Other fantasy writers have emulated him, and [[role-playing]] and [[computer games]] have also taken up this tradition.

The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be feudalistic evil empires or oligarchies, and are usually corrupt, despite the greater variety of the actual Middle Ages.<ref>Alec Austin, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020624/epic_fantasy.shtml "Quality in Epic Fantasy"]</ref> Settings also tend to be medieval in economy, with many fantasy worlds disproportionately [[pastoral]].<ref>[[Jane Yolen]], "Introduction" p viii ''After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, ISBN 0-312-85175-8</ref>

These settings are typical of [[epic fantasy]] and, to a lesser extent, of [[sword and sorcery]] — which contains more urban settings — than of fantasy in general; the preponderance of epic fantasy in the genre has made them fantasy commonplaces. They are less typical of [[contemporary fantasy]], especially [[urban fantasy]].

===The Ancient World===
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
A less common inspiration is the ancient world. A famous example is the [[Hyborian Age]] (the fictional world of ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]''), which features analogues of [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], and the [[Roman Empire]], among others. Two notable recent series to utalise this would be ''[[Bartimaeus (book series)|Bartimaeus]]'' by [[Jonathan Stroud]], ''[[Camp Half-Blood]]'' and ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' by [[Rick Riordan]], although they are both largely set in modern day.

==Other "races"==
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
Many fantasy stories and worlds refer to their main [[sapience|sapient]] [[humanoid]] [[species]] as "races" rather than species. In most such worlds these races are related, and capable of producing viable offspring together, typically having derived from one root species – most often either elves or humans - by [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] or [[divinity|divine]] influence, or by [[intelligent design]]. The usage of the term in this context was popularized by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} and was further adapted and spread by the use of [[Character race (Dungeons & Dragons)|races]] in ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]]s.<ref>{{cite book| first=Ian | last=Livingstone| year=1982 | title=Dicing with Dragons| publisher=Routledge | isbn=0710094663 | page=74 }}</ref> Many fantasy settings use the terms "race" and "species" interchangeably.

In role-playing games, "race" typically refers to any species that can be used as a [[player character]]. In older editions of ''Dungeons & Dragons'', the primary non-human player races ([[Dwarf (Dungeons & Dragons)|dwarf]], [[Elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|elf]], [[Gnome (Dungeons & Dragons)|gnome]], [[halfling]], and [[Half-elf (Dungeons & Dragons)|half-elf]]) were called "demi-humans". Later games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]'' use the term "metahuman", and define these humanoid races as subdivisions of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. 

Other races include Orcs, which were popularized in ''Lord of The Rings'' by J. R. R. Tolkien. They are now used in many fantasy worlds and are often depicted as large, green brutish creatures with more muscle than brains.

Other races include various humanoid creatures that appear like animals like wolves, bears, boars and other animal species.
