'''Rom''' is a [[fictional character]], a cosmic [[superhero]] in the {{Marvel Universe}}.  He first appears in ''Rom, Spaceknight'' #1 (Dec. 1979) and was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[Sal Buscema]].

==Publication history==
===Toy===
"Rom The Space Knight" was a toy co-created by Bing McCoy, Scott Dankman, and Richard Levy (US Patent #4,267,551).<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&r=1&l=50&f=G&d=PALL&s1=4267551.PN.&OS=PN/4267551&RS=PN/4267551 US Patent #4,267,551]</ref> It was sold to [[Parker Brothers]], and was the inspiration for the [[comic book]] series.<ref>[http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/actionfig/mccoy.shtml Interview, McCoy, Bing]. [http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/ Rom Spaceknight Revisited fan site]. Retrieved on 2007-03-25.<br>* [http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/ Rom Spaceknight Revisited fan site]. Retrieved on 2007-03-25.</ref>  The toy was originally called [[COBOL]] (after the programming language), which was later changed to "Rom" (after [[Read-only memory|ROM]], read-only memory) by Parker Brothers executives.

The toy set a precedent for the game publishing company, which up until that time had only ever produced [[board games]]. As this was a new venture for the company and given that electronic toys were still very new, a decision was made to produce the figure as cheaply as possible. As a result, the final product had very few points of articulation, and twin red [[LED]]s served as Rom's eyes instead of the originally envisioned green, which were more expensive to produce.<ref name="Interview, McCoy, Bing">[http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/actionfig/mccoy.shtml Interview, McCoy, Bing], [http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/comics/Rom/ Rom Spaceknight Revisited fan site]. Retrieved on 2007-03-25.</ref>

Not long after its debut, Rom appeared in the corner box of the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's December 10, 1979 issue. It was also featured in the interior article, "Those Beeping, Thinking Toys", which decried Rom's lack of articulation and predicted it would "end up among the dust balls under the [[living room|playroom]] [[couch|sofa]]."<ref>Skow, John. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912568,00.html "Those Thinking, Bleeping Toys"], ''Time'' magazine, December 10, 1979. Retrieved on 2007-03-11.</ref>
[[Image:RomToy.jpg|180px|thumb|left|The Rom toy in box. ROM is trademark and copyright Parker Brothers (brand of Hasbro) 1979.]]
ROM was licensed to [[Palitoy]] in the UK to extend the "Space Adventurer" line of [[Action Man]], appearing in their 1980 catalog.

===Comic===
To build interest in the toy, Parker Brothers licensed the character to [[Marvel Comics]] which created a  comic book featuring Rom. The comic expanded on the premise that Rom was a [[cyborg]] and gave him an origin, personality, set of supporting characters and villains, as well as interaction within the [[Marvel Universe]]. The comic was written by [[Bill Mantlo]] and initially illustrated by artist [[Sal Buscema]].

Ultimately, the toy failed and only sold 200,000 to 300,000 units<!--this is quite a large range--> in the US, with creator McCoy blaming the failure on poor packaging and marketing.<ref name="Interview, McCoy, Bing"/> Parker Brothers subsequently abandoned the line and returned to manufacturing board games.

Regardless and with some irony, the comic book outlasted the toy which it was created to support. The series lasted for 75 issues over a seven year period, with Rom's regular encounters with mainstream heroes and villains establishing him as part of Marvel continuity.<ref name="Rom-1-75">''Rom'' #1–75 (December 1979 – February 1986) and ''Rom Annual'' #1–4 (1982–1985)</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
In the comic book, Rom is more than a simple cyborg, being originally from a utopian society on a planet called Galador. The series details Rom's defeat of an invading alien race known as [[Dire Wraith]]s, and the continuation of their battle on Earth and other planets.<ref name="Rom-1-75"/>  Unlike the technologically advanced Galadorian civilization, the Dire Wraiths rely primarily on dark magic and their power to change their appearance.

Some years before Rom's arrival on Earth, Galador is threatened by a fleet of ships manned by the Dire Wraiths. Galador's ruler, the Prime Director, calls for volunteers to be transformed into [[cyborg]] warriors called '[[Spaceknights]]', so that they can defend the planet from the invaders. The volunteers are promised that their "humanity" (that is, the body parts that would be removed to accommodate the bionic armor) would be preserved and restored to them after the danger was over. Rom was the first to volunteer, and was transformed into a large, silver humanoid that at first glance appeared to be totally robotic. Rom was also given Galador's greatest weapon - the Neutralizer -  which on one setting could banish the Wraiths into the dimension known as [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] forever. Inspired by his example, a total of 1,000 Galadorians volunteered and were transformed into Spaceknights, each with his or her own unique armour, powers and code names.<ref name="Rom">''Rom'' #1 (Dec. 1979)</ref>

The Spaceknights succeeded in stopping the Wraith invasion, although Rom decided to follow the remnants of the fleet back to their home planet – Wraithworld – which orbited a black sun. The Wraiths panicked, and after a futile counter-attack abandoned the planet and scattered throughout space.<ref>''Rom'' Annual #2 (1983).</ref> Unable to stop Rom, the Wraiths successfully used their sorcery to trick him into allowing their escape.  Rom now felt responsible for spreading the Wraiths’ evil across the universe, and swore he would not reclaim his humanity until all Dire Wraiths had been vanquished. His fellow Spaceknights, including comrades Starshine and Terminator, swore the same oath and left Galador.<ref name="Rom"/>

===Earthfall===
Rom arrives on Earth 200 years later, and it is at this point that the Rom series begins. Landing near the fictional town of Clairton, in [[West Virginia]], [[United States|USA]], Rom encounters a young woman named Brandy Clark. After seeing Rom deal with the Wraiths firsthand, Brandy comes to understand his mission and helps to hide Rom from prying eyes. This becomes necessary once Rom uses the Neutralizer in public, as witnesses only see a "killer robot" disintegrating innocents - they do not realize that Rom is in fact banishing Wraiths in human form. In time Brandy's boyfriend, Steve Jackson, also helps Rom in his mission, although when Brandy began to fall in love with the noble Rom her relationship with Steve was strained.<ref name="Rom"/>

During his time on Earth, Rom fights and banishes thousands of Wraiths. The increasingly desperate Wraiths also create new foes for Rom, such as the sorcerous Hellhounds, robotic Watchwraiths and Firefall - a fusion of human and Spaceknight.<ref>''Rom'' #4 (March 1980), #6 (May 1980), & #16 (March 1981)</ref> Two of Rom's greatest foes are the aptly named Hybrid<ref>''Rom'' #17-#18 (April - May 1981) and  #31-#32 (June - July 1982)</ref> (a hideous result of a union between Wraith and human), and Mentus (a suit of Spaceknight armor occupied by the dark side of the Prime Director's psyche).<ref>''Rom'' #25 (Dec. 1981)</ref> Many other opponents were more traditional and hailed from the Marvel Universe proper, such as the [[Mad Thinker]],<ref>''Rom'' #14 (Jan. 1981)</ref> the [[Space Phantom]],<ref>''Rom'' #19 (June 1981)</ref> and the herald of [[Galactus]], [[Terrax]].<ref>''Rom'' #26 (Jan. 1982)</ref> Rom was one of the many heroes transported into an arena in space for the Contest of Champions though he was not chosen to participate. <ref> ''Contest of Champions'' (vol.1) #1,</ref>

At one stage, Rom's war against the Wraiths takes a turn for the worse - a new breed of Wraith appeared on Earth, and appeared to be far deadlier than the first variety.<ref>''Rom'' #47 (Oct. 1983)</ref> It is later revealed that these are female Wraiths, who rely on sorcery, as opposed to the weaker males who placed their faith in science. Unlike the males, the female Wraiths chose not to act in secrecy and openly attack Clairton while Rom is away, killing everyone (including Steve Jackson and superhero ally the Torpedo) with the exception of Brandy Clark. Furthermore, they also attack [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s mobile headquarters, the [[Helicarrier]], which gave Earth authorities clear evidence of the existence and threat of the Dire Wraiths. Rom manages to banish all Dire Wraiths on Earth to Limbo with the aid of his super-powered allies and members of the U.S. military.<ref name="Rom "/>

===Endgame===
Rom leaves Earth soon after the battle and returns to Galador. Unknown to Rom, however, Brandy had accidentally met the entity called the [[Beyonder (comics)|Beyonder]], and asked him to transport her to Galador. The Beyonder complied and Brandy found herself on Galador, now a war-torn world occupied by a new generation of cyborg-Spaceknights. Created to defend Galador in the absence of the first Spaceknights, this next generation of cyborgs became corrupted by their power, and feeling superior to normal Galadorians, massacred the entire race. In an act of sheer spite the new Spaceknights also destroyed the frozen remains of the originals. Rom arrived too late and could only save Brandy. Enraged, Rom summoned the original Spaceknights and together they destroyed the traitors. Rom then made a surprising discovery - his original humanity persisted within the entombed body of Terminator. Reclaiming it, Rom became human again and finally admitted his love for Brandy. The two chose to remain on Galador, with the intent of repopulating the planet. The remaining Spaceknights, their humanity now lost, set out to explore the universe, except for a few others that remained on Galador to protect Rom and Brandy.<ref>''Rom'' #72-#75 (Nov. 1985 - Feb. 1986)</ref>

During the wedding of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to [[Marlo Chandler]], the now human Rom returned to Earth, together with Brandy, as guests at the ceremony, and Rom greeted the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] with a friendly handshake.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #418 (June 1994)</ref>

===Starlin miniseries===
In the ''Spaceknights'' miniseries  (Oct. 2000 - Feb. 2001) written by [[Jim Starlin]] it is revealed that Rom took the name Artour (a reference to Brandy's love of Arthurian legends, and perhaps in memory of his own encounter with King Arthur's ghost<ref>''Rom'' #37 (Dec. 1982)</ref>), and that he and Brandy had two sons. However, Rom himself is not actually seen in the series, nor is he mentioned by that name or shown in his spaceknight form (no doubt to skirt the fact that Marvel no longer held the license from Parker Brothers, which had retained the copyrights on Rom's name and armored likeness); his ship is attacked off panel just prior to the start of the story, with Rom himself missing and presumed dead.

==Powers and abilities==
Rom’s armor was composed of the [[Galador]]ian metal '''plandanium'''.  It is extremely durable, even going so far as to stand up to [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine's]] [[adamantium]] claws.  It was shown to be damaged from time to time, demonstrating that plandanium is not indestructible.  The armor had self-repair capabilities, though it took several weeks to repair major damage. It provided him with superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to travel through [[outer space|space]] via backpack rockets. It also allowed him to breathe in any [[atmosphere]] and survive in the vacuum of space. Controls near the torso allowed Rom to lower the armor's temperature to well below zero.  The armor also stored a "solar charge" that could be used as a weapon and could also drain power sources by mere contact. It also gave him the ability to summon three pieces of equipment stored in "[[Hyperspace (science fiction)|subspace]]":
;'''Neutralizer''' : Rom's primary weapon, which is designed to banish Dire Wraiths to Limbo by opening a dimensional portal.  Unfortunately, the process leaves considerable waste material that makes it appear that the weapon kills its target to an uninformed observer. In addition, the Dire Wraiths unsuccessfully explored the possibility of examining the gun to find some means of returning its victims to the normal dimension.  This handheld weapon could fire energy beams that can be deadly at a high setting if Rom chose to select it and it can neutralize various forms of energy. This device was designed so that only Rom would be able to discharge it. The mutant Wolverine once tried to use the weapon and received a numbing blast of energy feedback.<ref>''Rom'' #18 (May 1981)</ref> Rom's Neutralizer would inspire a similar creation by the mutant [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] when the US government tasked him with constructing a weapon against the Wraith horde. It is notable that his neutralizer for a time cost [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] her mutant abilities.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #185</ref>
;'''Analyzer''' : Allowed Rom to see shape-changed Dire Wraiths in their true form and could assess the energy and potential of any object/entity.  It could also be used on an item which represented a world, such as a [[globe]], and would display lights corresponding to Dire Wraith infestations at that point on the planet.  Unfortunately, the device resembles a [[handgun]], and Dire Wraith imposters have taken advantage of this fact to fool others into thinking that Rom is attacking them.  Rom once arranged an ally to have the equivalent kind of vision, but the Dire Wraiths counteracted that by magically blocking his mind from recognizing that particular visual data.  Regardless, Rom allowed [[SHIELD]] to examine the Analyzer in hope of creating equivalent devices among the Spaceknight's human allies.
;'''Universal Translator''' : Allowed Rom to instantly learn the language of any creature, irrespective of their origin. This device was also used to scan and store printed information from an encyclopedia in Rom's [[memory bank]]s for future use.

==Other versions==

As Marvel Comics no longer possesses the licensing rights to Rom from Parker Brothers, the character is not allowed to appear in his armored form. However, Marvel has found ways to work around this dilemma.
*In 2000, Marvel published a five-issue ''SpaceKnights'' series which featured a hero named Prince Tristan (codenamed "Liberator") in a redesigned version of Rom's armor.  He fought along side other SpaceKnights named after some of the more popular ones from the original series.
*In the ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)#Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]'' series featuring [[Genis-Vell]], Rick Jones was shown to own a toaster in the shape of Rom's helmet.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 4, #1-#35 (Jan 2000 - Oct. 2002)</ref>
*In the alternate world of [[Earth X]], Rom had ironically been banished to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and was battling against the very Dire Wraiths he had sent there. Rom was seen in human form wielding his Neutralizer and using his chest-plate as a shield. He was referred to only as "the Greatest Spaceknight."<ref>''Earth X'' #0-#X (March 1999 - June 2000).</ref>
*In 2006, Marvel reprinted the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' as part of their [[Essential Marvel|Essentials]] line of [[trade paperback]]s, including the Rom entries.
*In [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]] 12.1 (2011), the super-villain group, The Intelligencia, was seen working with a 'spaceknight' that had actually been hosting the Ultron A.I.<ref>The Avengers 12.1</ref>

==In other media==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
*In the ''[[South Park]]'' [[trilogy]] [[Imaginationland]], which featured  many loosely adapted fictional characters from a variety of sources, a character based on Rom can be seen several times in the background.  
*Rom appears in the television series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "[[Metal Militia (Robot Chicken episode)|Metal Militia]]", (voiced by [[Seth Green]]) in which he is shown to be powerless against Jim, a man with a giant magnet (voiced by [[Breckin Meyer]]).
*The Rom toy is significant in the James Gunn novel ''[[The Toy Collector]]'', motivating the protagonist to fund his toy-collecting with stolen pharmaceuticals.
*Rom is mentioned by the [[RZA]] in the song "Impossible" off of [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s seminal ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'', and in the song "Back When I was Four" by musician [[Jeffrey Lewis]]. 
*A character highly reminiscent of Rom appeared in the background of the [[Silver Surfer (1998 TV series)|Silver Surfer cartoon]] episode "[[List of Silver Surfer (TV series) episodes|Learning Curve]]" as the title character walks down a street on an alien world.
