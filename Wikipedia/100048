'''Cambrai''' ({{IPA-fr|kɑ̃bʁɛ|}}; {{lang-nl|Kamerijk}}; {{lang-de|Kamerich}}; old spelling ''Cambray'') is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Nord (department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northern [[France]]. It is a [[Subprefectures in France|sub-prefecture]] of the department.

Cambrai is the seat of [[Archdiocese of Cambrai|an archdiocese]] whose jurisdiction was immense during the [[Middle Ages]].  The territory of the [[Bishopric of Cambrai]], roughly coinciding with the shire of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], included the central part of the [[Low Countries]].  The bishopric had some limited secular power.

Cambrai was the Duke of Wellington's headquarters, for the British Army of Occupation, from 1815 to 1818.

The [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] (20 November 1917 – 3 December 1917), a campaign of [[World War I]] took place there. It was noted for the first successful use of [[tank]]s. A second [[Battle of Cambrai (1918)|Battle of Cambrai]] took place between 8 October 1918 – 10 October 1918 as part of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]].

==History==
===Roman times===
[[File:Peutinger Casaromago.jpg|thumb|left|An extract from the Peutinger table showing Camaraco (Cambrai) northeast of Sammarobriva (present-day [[Amiens]])]]
Little is known with certainty of the beginnings of Cambrai. ''Camaracum'' or ''Camaraco'', as it was known to the Romans, is mentioned for the first time on the [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Peutinger table]] in the middle of the 4th century. It was a town of the [[Nervii]], whose "capital" was at ''Bagacum'', present-day [[Bavay]].

In the middle of the 4th-century [[Franks|Frankish]] raids from the north led the Romans to build forts along the Cologne to Bavay to Cambrai road, and thence to Boulogne. Cambrai thus occupied an important strategic position. In the early 5th century the town had become the administrative centre of the Nervii in replacement of Bavay which was probably too exposed to the Franks' raids and perhaps too damaged.

[[Christianity]] arrived in the region at about the same time. A bishop of the Nervii by the name of ''Superior'' is mentioned in the middle of the 4th century, but nothing else is known about him.

In 430 the [[Salian Franks]] under the command of [[Clodio]] the Long-Haired took the town. In the early 6th century [[Clovis I|Clovis]] undertook to unify the Frankish kingdoms by getting rid of his relatives. One of them was Ragnachar, who ruled over a small kingdom from Cambrai.

===Middle Ages===
Cambrai began to grow from a rural market into a real city during the [[Merovingian]] times, a long period of peace when the bishoprics of Arras and Cambrai were first unified (probably owing to the small number of clerics left at the time) and were later transferred to Cambrai, an administrative centre for the region. Successive bishops, including [[Gaugericus]] (in French Géry), founded abbeys and churches to host relics, which contributed powerfully to giving Cambrai both the appearance and functions of a city.

When the [[treaty of Verdun]] (843) split [[Charlemagne]]'s empire into three parts the county of Cambrai fell into [[Lothaire]]'s kingdom. However on the death of [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]], who had no heir, king [[Charles the Bald]] tried to gain control of his kingdom by having himself sacred at [[Metz]]. Cambrai thus reverted, but only briefly, to the [[West Francia|Western Frankish Realm]]. In 870 the town was destroyed by the Normans.<ref>1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, "Cambrai"</ref>

By 925 [[Henry I of Germany|Henry the Fowler]] had regained control of Lothair's former domains. Cambrai henceforth belonged to the [[Holy Roman Empire]], in an uncomfortable position on the border with France, until it was annexed by [[France]] eight centuries later after being captured by [[Louis XIV]] in 1677.

In the Middle Ages the region around Cambrai, called Cambrésis, was a county. Rivalries between the count, who ruled the city and county, and the bishop, ceased when in 948 [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] granted the [[Archdiocese of Cambrai|bishop]] with temporal powers over the city. In 1007 emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]], extended the bishop's temporal power to the territory surrounding Cambrai. The bishops then had both spiritual and temporal powers. This made Cambrai and Cambrésis a church principality, much like [[Liège]], an independent state which was part of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 958 one of the first [[Communes of France|communes]] in Europe was established in Cambrai. The inhabitants rebelled against the bishop's power and abuses. They were severely repressed, but the discontent flared up again in the 10th and 11th centuries. In 1226, following another period of unrest, the [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]] of Cambrai finally had to give up their charters and accept the bishop's authority, while retaining some freedom in the running of the town.

====Economic activity====
In the Middle Ages the city grew richer and larger thanks to its weaving industry which produced woollen cloth, linen and [[cambric]]. Cambrai then belonged to a commercial hansa of seventeen low country cities whose aim was to develop trade with the fairs in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] and  [[Paris]]. By the 11th century the city walls had reached the circumference they would keep until the 19th century.

====Music history====
[[File:DufayBinchois.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Dufay (left) in conversation with [[Gilles Binchois]]]]
Cambrai has a distinguished musical history, particularly in the 15th century.  The [[Old Cambrai Cathedral|cathedral]] there, a musical center until the 17th century, had one of the most active musical establishments in the Low Countries; many composers of the [[Burgundian School]] either grew up and learned their craft there, or returned to teach. In 1428 Philippe de Luxembourg claimed that the cathedral was the finest in all of Christianity, for the fineness of its singing, its light, and the sweetness of its bells.  [[Guillaume Dufay]], the most famous European musician of the 15th century, studied at the cathedral from 1409 to 1412, and returned in 1439 after spending many years in Italy. Cambrai cathedral had other famous composers in the later 15th century: [[Johannes Tinctoris]] and [[Johannes Ockeghem|Ockeghem]] went to Cambrai to study with Dufay. Other composers included [[Nicolas Grenon]], [[Alexander Agricola]], and [[Jacob Obrecht]]. In the 16th century, [[Philippe de Monte]], [[Johannes Lupi]], and [[Jacobus de Kerle]] all worked there.

====Hundred Years' War====
Even though the bishop tried to preserve the independence of his small state of Cambrésis, the task was not easy, wedged as the county was between its more powerful neighbours the counts of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and the kings of [[France]], especially during the [[Hundred Years' War]].
In 1339, in the early stages of the war, the English king [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] laid siege to the city but eventually had to withdraw. By the 14th century the county was surrounded on all parts by [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]'s possessions and [[John of Burgundy, Bishop of Cambrai|John of Burgundy]], an illegitimate son of [[John the Fearless]], was made bishop. However what looked like an impending annexation of Cambrésis to the states of Burgundy was made impossible by the sudden death of [[Charles the Bold]] in 1477. [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] immediately seized the opportunity to take control of Cambrai, but left the city a year later.

====The legend of Martin and Martine====
[[File:Carillon-Cambrai.jpg|thumb|Martin and Martine strike the hours in the bell tower of Cambrai's town hall]]
Martin and Martine are two legendary characters who have come to represent the city which they are said to have saved. There are different versions of the story. The most commonly accepted version runs as follows: around the year 1370, at the time of Bishop Robert, Count of Geneva, Martin, a blacksmith of [[Moorish]] descent established in Cambrai, was among the burghers who left the city to fight the lord of [[Thun-Lévêque]], who was then reputed to ransom the population around the city and generally to afflict the region. Martin, armed only with his heavy iron hammer, soon came face to face with the enemy. He dealt such a heavy blow on his opponent's head that, although the helmet of the lord did not break, because it was made of good steel, it was driven down to his eyes. Dazed and blinded, the lord of Thun quickly surrendered. Today the automatons of Martin and Martine, standing at the top of the town hall, strike the hours with a hammer as a reminder of that mighty blow.

===The Renaissance and classical age===
As the economic centre of northern Europe moved away from [[Bruges]], the area became poorer, with an associated period of cultural decline. However the city's neutrality and its position between the possessions of the [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[France]] made it the venue of several international negotiations, including the [[League of Cambrai]], an alliance engineered in 1508 by [[Pope Julius II]] against the [[Republic of Venice]]. The alliance collapsed in 1510 when the Pope allied with Venice against his former ally [[France]]. The conflict is also referred to as the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] and lasted from 1508 to 1516. Cambrai was also the site of negotiations in 1529 that led to France's withdrawal from the [[War of the League of Cognac]].

[[File:Maison des Canonniers Cambrai.JPG|thumb|The "gunners' house" in Cambrai is an example of 17th century Flemish architecture]]

In 1543 Cambrai was conquered by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], and annexed to his already vast possessions. He had the medieval monastery of Saint-Sépulchre demolished and a citadel built in its place.

In 1623, the community of nuns of the [[English Benedictine Congregation]] was founded at Cambrai, which was expelled during the French Revolution and its successor community has since 1838 been established at [[Stanbrook Abbey]], near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]].

In 1677, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], in an effort to "safeguard the tranquility of his borders for ever" ("''assurer à jamais le repos de ses frontières''"), decided to take Cambrai and supervised the [[Siege of Cambrai (1677)|siege]] in person. The city was taken on April 19, 1677. By the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]] of 1678 Spain relinquished Cambrai, which has remained to this day a part of France.

The first archbishop appointed by the king of France was [[François Fénelon]]. He came to be known as the "swan of Cambrai" ("''le cygne de Cambrai''"), in opposition to his rival [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]], the "eagle of Meaux" ("''l'aigle de Meaux''"), and he wrote his ''Maxims of the Saints'' while residing in the city. Despite this, the Flemish philosopher Robert Bénart said, as early as 1765, "Cambrai est un bourg souffrant d'une cruelle inactivité et aux habitants stupides." ("Voyages en Flandre", 1767.)

===The French Revolution===
<!--[[File:A Thanksgiving Service Attended by Canadian Troops Being Held in the Cambrai Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Canadian Soldiers at a Thanksgiving ceremony at Cambrai Cathedral WWI]]-->

The city suffered from the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]: [[Joseph Le Bon]], sent by the [[Comité de salut public]], arrived in Cambrai in 1794. He was to set up an era of "terror", sending many to the [[guillotine]], until he was tried and executed in 1795. Most of the religious buildings of the city were demolished in that period: in 1797, the [[Old Cambrai Cathedral|old cathedral]], which had been dubbed the "wonder of the low countries", was sold to a merchant who exploited it as a stone quarry. Only the main tower was left standing by 1809, when it collapsed in a storm. However the cathedral's archives have been preserved (they are now at the Archives Départementales du Nord in [[Lille]]) and a [[Cambrai Cathedral|new cathedral]] was later provided.
