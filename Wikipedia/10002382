'''Argentina–Chile relations''' refers to [[interstate relations]] between the [[Chile|Republic of Chile]] and the [[Argentina|Argentine Republic]]. Argentina and Chile share the world's third-longest international border, which is {{convert|5300|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and runs from north to the south along the [[Andes]] mountains. Although gaining their independency together, during much of the 19th and the 20th century, relations between the countries chilled due to disputes over [[Patagonia]], though in recent years relations have improved dramatically. Despite increased trade between the two countries they have followed quite different economic policies; Chile has signed free trade agreements with countries such as China, the USA, Canada, South Korea and the EU and is an active member of the [[APEC]], while Argentina belongs to the [[Mercosur]] regional free trade area. Both countries are members of the [[Union of South American Nations]].

==Historical relations (1550–1989)==
===Rule under Spain and Independence===
[[Image:5 abrazo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''El abrazo de Maipú'' (English: The embrace of Maipú) between the independence heroes [[José de San Martín]] and [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] after the defeat of [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] in the [[Battle of Maipú]]]]

The relationship between the two countries can be traced back to an alliance during colonial times. Both colonies were offshoots of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], with the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] (which Argentina was a part of) being broken off in 1776, and [[Chile]] not being broken off until independence. Argentina and Chile were however colonized in different processes, Chile was conquered as a southward extension of the [[conquest of Peru]] while Argentina was colonized both from Peru, Chile and from the Atlantic.

Argentina and Chile were close allies during the [[Spanish American wars of independence|wars of independence]] from the [[Spanish Empire]]. Chile, like most of the revolting colonies, was [[Chilean War of Independence|defeated at a point]] by Spanish armies, while Argentina remained independent throughout its [[Argentine War of Independence|war of independence]]. After the Chilean defeat in the [[Disaster of Rancagua]], the remnants of the Chilean Army led by [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] took refuge in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]]. Argentine General [[José de San Martín]], by that time governor of the [[Province of Cuyo|region]], included the Chilean exiles in the [[Army of the Andes]], and in 1817 led the [[crossing of the Andes]], defeated the Spaniards, and confirmed the [[Chilean Independence]]. While he was in [[Santiago, Chile]] a [[Cabildo (council)|cabildo abierto]] (open town hall meeting) offered San Martín the governorship of Chile, which he declined, in order to continue the [[Peruvian War of Independence|liberating campaign in Peru]].

===First Chilean Navy Squadron===
{{main|First Chilean Navy Squadron}}
In 1817 Chile began the build up of its Navy in order to carry the war to the [[Viceroyalty of Perú]]. Chile and Argentina signed a treaty in order to finance the enterprise.<ref>''The annual register, or, A view of the history, politics, and literature for 1819'', Volume 61, John Davis Batchelder Collection (Library of Congress) [http://books.google.de/books?id=CXUEAAAAQAAJ url], page 138</ref> But Argentina, fallen in a Civil war, was unable to contribute. The naval fleet, after being built, launched a sea campaign to fight the Spanish fleet in the Pacific to liberate Peru. After a successful land and sea campaign, San Martín proclaimed the [[Independence of Peru]] in 1821.

===War against the Peru–Bolivian Confederation===
{{Main|War of the Confederation}}
From 1836 to 1839 Chile and Argentine fought united against the confederation due the potential power of this aroused the opposition of Argentina and, above all, Chile, due not only to its great territorial expanse but also to the perceived threat that such a rich state signified for the area. Chile declared the war on 11 November 1836 and Argentina on 19 May 1837<ref name="rosa">José María Rosa, "Historia argentina: Unitarios y federales (1826–1841)", http://books.google.de/books?id=i39pAAAAIAAJ</ref>{{rp|page=263ff}}.

In 1837 Felipe Braun, one of [[Andrés de Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]]'s most capable generals and high decorated veteran of the war of independence, defeated an Argentine army sent to topple Santa Cruz. On 12 November 1838 Argentine representants signed an agreement with the Bolivian troops.<ref name="rosa"/>{{rp|page=271}}. On 20 January 1839 the Chilean troops obtained a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Yungay]] and the short-lived Peru-Bolivian Confederation now came to an end.

===Chincha's war===
{{Main|Chincha Islands War}}
During a series of coastal and naval battles between Spain and its former colonies of [[Peru]] and Chile from 1864 to 1866, that began with Spain's seizure of the [[guano]]-rich [[Chincha Islands]], part of a series of attempts by [[Isabel II of Spain]] to reassert her country's lost influence in its former South American empire, an alliance was formed between [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], Peru and Chile against Spain. In this way, all the ports of the Pacific coast of South America south of Colombia became closed and hostile to the Spanish fleet. But Argentina refused to join the alliance and maintained amicable relations with Spain<ref>Spain and the American Civil War: relations at mid-century, 1855–1868, page 99, http://books.google.de/books?id=rWT-LdWMdI0C</ref> and delivered coal to the Spanish fleet.

===War of the Pacific===
Peru and Bolivia signed on 6 February 1873 in [[Lima]] the secret [[Treaty of alliance between Peru and Bolivia of 1873|Treaty of alliance]] against Chile and on 24 September the Argentine president [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] asked the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] to join. The chamber approved with 48 to 18 votes the treaty and made available a credit of 6.000.000 pesos for military spending. But in 1874, after the delivery of the [[Chilean ironclad Almirante Cochrane]] and the [[Chilean ironclad Blanco Encalada|ironclad Blanco Encalada]], the [[Argentine Senate]] postponed the matter until the end of 1874 and Sarmiento could not sign the treaty.<ref>[http://www.ucema.edu.ar/ceieg/arg-rree/6/6-066.htm Las relaciones con los demás países americanos durante las presidencias de Mitre y Sarmiento]</ref> During the war Argentina remain neutral and signed with Chile the Border Treaty of 1881.

===Claims on Patagonia===
{{See also|Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina|Treaty of Arbitration between Chile and Argentina of 1902}}

The border disputes continued as Patagonia was still an unexplored area. The Border treaty of 1881 established the highest mountains that divides the drainage basins to the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic as the border. This concept was easy to apply in northern regions but in Patagonia drainage basins crossed the Andes; this led to dispute what over the highest peaks would be the frontier (favouring Argentina) or the drainage basins (favouring Chile). Argentina argued that previous documents referring to the boundary always mentioned the ''Snowy Cordillera'' as the frontier and not the [[continental divide]]. The Argentine explorer [[Francisco Perito Moreno]] suggested that many Patagonian lakes draining to the Pacific were in fact part of the Atlantic basin but had been [[moraine-dammed lake|moraine-dammed]] during the [[quaternary]] [[glaciation]]s changing their outlets to the west. In 1902, war was again avoided when British King [[Edward VII]] agreed to mediate between the two nations. He established the current border in the Patagonia region in part by dividing many disputed lakes into two equal parts, most of these lakes still have one name on each side of the frontier. A dispute that arose in the northern [[Puna de Atacama]] was resolved with the [[Puna de Atacama Lawsuit]] of 1899.

===Baltimore Crisis===
{{Main|Baltimore Crisis}}
During the Baltimore Crisis, that brought Chile and the United States on the brink of war in 1891, at the end of the [[Chilean Civil War]], the Argentine foreign minister [[Estanislao Zeballos]] offered to the US-minister in Buenos Aires the Argentine province of [[Salta]] as basis to attack Chile overland<ref name="sater"/>{{rp|page=65}} in return for the session of southern
Chile to Argentina.<ref>Arthur Preston Whitaker, [http://books.google.de/books?id=K_8XAAAAYAAJ ''The United States and the southern cone: Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay''], Harvard University Press, 1976, page 34</ref> Later, Chile and the United States averted the war.

===Pactos de Mayo===
{{Main|Pactos de Mayo}}
The Pactos de Mayo are four protocols signed in Santiago de Chile by Chile and Argentina on 28 May 1902 in order to extend their relations and resolve its territorial disputes. The disputes had led both countries to increase their military budgets and run an [[arms race]] in the 1890s. More significantly the two countries divided their influence in Latin America into two spheres: Argentina would not threaten Chiles Pacific Coast hegemony, and Santiago promised not to intrude beyond the Andes.<ref name="sater">William F. Sater, ''Chile and the United States, Empires in Conflict'', University of Georgia Press, 1990, ISBN 0-8203-1249-5</ref>{{rp|page 71}}

===Dreadnought race===
{{main|South American dreadnought race}}
{{empty-section|date=December 2011}}

===Beagle conflict===
{{Main|Beagle conflict}}
Trouble once again began to brew in the 1960s, when Argentina began to claim that the [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands in the [[Beagle Channel]] were rightfully his, although this was in direct contradiction of the 1881 treaty, as the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration]], and the initial [[Beagle Channel cartography since 1881]] stated.

Both countries submitted the controversy to binding arbitration by the [[Beagle Channel Arbitration|international tribunal]]. The award (see Beagle Channel Arbitration between the Republic of Argentina and the Republic of Chile, [http://untreaty.un.org/cod/riaa/cases/vol_XXI/53-264.pdf''Report and Decision of the Court of Arbitration'']) recognized 1977 all the islands to Chile, but Argentine unilaterally repudiated the sentence and planned a [[war of aggression]] against Chile.<ref name=ari>[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/1998/12/20/i-00401e.htm ''Clarín''] de Buenos Aires 20 December 1998</ref>

In 1978 [[Direct negotiations between Chile and Argentina in 1977-78]] failed and relations became extremely tense. Chile and Argentina sent troops to the border in Patagonia and large areas were mined. Argentina started on 22 December the [[Operation Soberanía]] in order to invade the islands and continental Chile, but after few hours stopped the operation when the Pope [[John Paul II]] sent a personal message to both presidents urging a peaceful solution. Both countries agreed for the Pope to mediate the dispute through the offices of Cardinal [[Antonio Samoré]] his special envoy (See [[Papal mediation in the Beagle conflict]]).

On 9 January 1979 the [http://www.un.org/Depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/PDFFILES/TREATIES/CHL-ARG1979AM.PDF Act of Montevideo] was signed in [[Uruguay]] pledging both sides to a peaceful solution and a return to the military situation of early 1977. The conflict was still latent during the Falklands war and was resolved only after the fall of the Argentine military ''junta''.

A number of prominent public officials in Chile still point to past Argentine treaty repudiations when referring to relations between the two neighbors.<ref>See notes of the Chilean Foreign Minister [[Jose Miguel Insulza]], in ''La Tercera'' de Santiago de Chile 13 July 1998 [http://www.quepas.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,3255_5664_9525990,00.html "Enfatizó que, si bien la situación es diferente, lo que hoy está ocurriendo con el Tratado de Campo de Hielo Sur hace recordar a la opinión pública lo sucedido en 1977, durante la disputa territorial por el Canal de Beagle"]</ref><ref>See notes of Senator (not elected but named by the Armed Forces) [[Jorge Martínez Bush]] in ''La Tercera'' de Santiago de Chile 26 July 1998 [http://www.quepasa.cl/medio/articulo/0,0,3255_5664_9511527,00.html "El legislador expuso que los chilenos mantienen "muy fresca" en la memoria la situación creada cuando Argentina declaró nulo el arbitraje sobre el canal del Beagle, en 1978"]</ref><ref>See notes of the Chilean Foreign Minister [[Ignacio Walker]] [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/07/22/elpais/p-01901.htm "Y está en la retina de los chilenos el laudo de Su Majestad Británica, en el Beagle, que fue declarado insanablemente nulo por la Argentina.

===Falklands War===
{{Main|Falklands War}}
{{See also|Events leading to the Falklands War}}
During the Falklands War in 1982, with the still pending [[Beagle conflict]], Chile and Colombia became the only South American countries to abstain from voting in the [[TIAR]] (as did also USA and Trinidad Tobago).

The Argentine government planned to seize the disputed Beagle Channel islands after the occupation of the Falkland Islands. [[Basilio Lami Dozo]] former Chief of the [[Argentine Air Force]] during the Falklands war disclosed that [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] announced him that:
:''"[Chile] have to know what we are doing now, because they will be the next in turn.''<ref>Argentine newspaper [[Perfil]] [http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&ed=0420 Después de Malvinas, iban a atacar a Chile] on 22. November 2009, retrieved 22. November 2009:
: Para colmo, Galtieri dijo en un discurso: "Que saquen el ejemplo de lo que estamos haciendo ahora porque después les toca a ellos".</ref> 
Also [[Óscar Camilión]], the last Argentine Foreign Minister before the war (March 29, 1981 to December 11, 1981) stated that:
:''"The military planning was, after the solution of the Falklands case, to invade the disputed islands in the Beagle. That was the determination of the Argentine Navy."''<ref>Óscar Camilión, ''Memorias Políticas'', Editorial Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1999, page 281:
:''"Los planes militares eran, en la hipótesis de resolver el caso Malvinas, invadir las islas en disputa en el Beagle. Esa era la decisión de la Armada&nbsp;..."''</ref>
Such preparations were public. On June 2, 1982 the newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' published an article by Manfred Schönfeld explaining what would follow Argentina's expected victory in the Falkland Islands: 
:''"The war will not be finished for us, because after the defeat of our enemies in the Falklands, they must be blown away from [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands]], and all Argentine Austral archipelagos."''<ref>All articles of Manfred Schönfeld published by "La Prensa" from 10 January 1982 to 2 August 1982, are compiled in ''La Guerra Austral'', Manfred Schönfeld, Desafío Editores S.A., 1982, ISBN 950-0205-00-9</ref>
Argentine General Osiris Villegas called in April 1982, after the successful landing in the Falklands, to stop the negotiations with Chile and to seize also the islands south of the Beagle. In his book ''La propuesta pontificia y el espacio nacional comprometido'', (p.2), he asked:
:''no persistir en una diplomacia bilateral que durante años la ha inhibido para efectuar actos de posesión efectiva en las islas en litigio que son los hechos reales que garantizan el establecimiento de una soberanía usurpada y la preservación de la integridad del territorio nacional''.<ref>cited in ''A treinta años de la crisis del Beagle, Desarrollo de un modelo de negociación en la resolución del conflicto'' by Renato Valenzuela Ugarte and Fernando García Toso, in Chilean Magazine "Política y Estrategia", nr. 115)</ref>
This intention was probably known by the Chilean government<ref>Spanish newspaper [[El País]] on 11. April 1982 [http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/CHILE/ISLAS_MALVINAS/CANAL_DE_BEAGLE/LATINOAMERICA/ARGENTINA/REINO_UNIDO/GUERRA_DE_LAS_MALVINAS_/1982/Chile/teme/Argentina/pueda/repetir/accion/fuerza/canal/Beagle/elpepiint/19820411elpepiint_5/Tes Chile teme que Argentina pueda repetir una acción de fuerza en el canal de Beagle] retrieved on 11.

===Peace and Friendship Treaty===
{{Main|Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina}}
The ''Peace and Amity Treaty of 1984'' was an agreement signed in 1984 between Argentina and Chile establishing the friendship relation between the two countries. Particularly, the treaty also defines limitation of the [[Strait of Magellan]] and over the possession of the [[Picton, Lennox and Nueva]] islands and sea located south of [[Tierra del Fuego]], granting the islands to Chile, navigation rights to both countries and the most part of the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] eastwards of the Cape Horn-Meridian to Argentina. After that, other border disputes were resolved by peaceful means.

The 1984 treaty was succeeded by the ''Maipu Treaty of Integration and Cooperation'' (''Tratado de Maipú de Integración y Cooperación'') signed on October 30, 2009 <ref>[http://www.difrol.cl/index2.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=218&Itemid=24 Tratado de Maipu de Integración y Cooperacion entre Argentina y Chile]</ref>

===Corredor de la Paz ===
2004, Argentina proposed a to establish a "corridor" through Chilean territory under partial Argentine administration as a Bolivian outlet to sea. After talks with Chilean embassador in Argentina, the government of Kirchner pulled out the proposal and declared the issue as "concerning to Chile and Bolivia" only.<ref>Article [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/566728-juan-gabriel-valdez-hay-resabios-de-rivalidades-anacronicas ''Juan Gabriel Valdéz: "Hay resabios de rivalidades anacrónicas"''] in Argentina newspaper [La Nación]] on 25 January 2004 in Spanish language, retrieved on 10 January 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.losandes.com.ar/notas/2004/1/16/politica-301282.asp Abihaggle: “Es un tema bilateral”]</ref>

==Integration==
In the 1990s relations improved dramatically. The dictator and last president of the Argentine [[Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional|Military Junta]] General [[Reynaldo Bignone]] called for democratic elections in 1983 and [[Augusto Pinochet]] of Chile in 1989. As a consequence militaristic tendencies faded in the [[Southern Cone]]. The Argentine presidents [[Carlos Menem]] and [[Fernando de la Rúa]] had particularly good relations with Chile.

===Border issues===
In bilateral manner, both countries settled all the remaining disputes except ''Laguna del Desierto'', which was decided by International Arbitration in 1994. The decision favoured Argentine claims.

According to a 1998 negotiation held in Buenos Aires, a {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the boundary in the [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]] is still pending of mapping and demarcation according to the limits already settled by the 1881 treaty. In 2006 president [[Néstor Kirchner]] invited Chile to define the border, but [[Michelle Bachelet]]'s government left the invitation unanswered.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2006/08/30/um/m-01262333.htm Tras la fricción por los Hielos Continentales, la Argentina llama a Chile a demarcar los límites "lo antes posible"]</ref> The same year, the Chilean government sent a note to Argentina complaining about Argentine tourism maps that showed a normal boundary in the Southern Patagonian Icefield with most of the area belonging to Argentina.

Geopolitics over Antarctica and the control of the passages between the south Atlantic and the south Pacific have led to the founding of cities and towns such as [[Ushuaia]] and [[Puerto Williams]] both claiming to be the southernmost cities in world.
Actually in Antarctica both countries, along with the United Kingdom, have [[List of research stations in Antarctica|research bases]]. The three nations claim the totality of [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

===Economy and energy===
Trade between the two countries is made mostly over the [[mountain passes]] <sup> ([http://www.gendarmeria.gov.ar/pasos/chile.htm see list]) </sup> that have enough infrastructure for large scale trade.
The trade balance shows a lot of asymmetry as of 2005 Chile is the 3rd export trading partner for Argentina, behind Brazil and the United States.<ref>[http://www.indexmundi.com/argentina/exports_partners.html Argentina Exports - partners - Economy]</ref> Some well known import products from Argentina in Chile include cereals and meat that once caused the [[Meat riots]] in Chile. More recently large amounts of Chilean capital have been invested in Argentina, especially in the retail market.

In 1996, Chile became an associated member of [[Mercosur]], a regional trade agreement that Argentina and Brazil created in the 1990s. This associated membership does not mean full membership.

In 1997, Argentina and Chile signed a Mining Integration Agreement.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Argentina–Chile_relations&action=edit&section=9 Tratado Sobre Integración y Complementación Minera entre las repúblicas de Chile y Argentina]</ref> In 2009 they gave the go-ahead for the $3-billion [[Pascua Lama]] project<ref>[http://www.miningweekly.com/article/argentina-celebrates-mining-day-pascua-lama-go-ahead-2009-05-08 Argentina celebrates mining day, Pascua Lama go-ahead]</ref> to mine an [[ore]] body on the border of the two countries.

====Gas====
Argentine president [[Carlos Menem]] signed a [[natural gas]] exportation treaty with Chilean president [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] in 1996. In 2005, President [[Néstor Kirchner]] suspended the treaty due to a [[2004 Argentine energy crisis|supply shortage]] experienced by Argentina. The situation in Argentina was partly resolved when Argentina increased its own imports from [[Bolivia]], a country with no diplomatic relations with Chile since 1978. In the import contract signed with Bolivia it was specified that not even a drop of Bolivian gas could be sold to Chile from Argentina.

===Sports===
In 2003, Argentine [[Argentine Football Association|AFA]]'s president suggested that both countries launch a joint bid for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] but was abandoned in favour of
a [[CONMEBOL]] unified posture to allow the tournament be hosted in Brazil.

In 2009, both countries organized the [[Dakar Rally]], the first time the competition goes out of Africa. The event repeated in 2010 <ref>[http://www.servicios.clarin.com/notas/jsp/clarin/v9/galeria/galeria.jsp?notaId=1847570&mtmTipo=Imagen&mostrar=1097217]</ref> and would be again in 2011 <ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2010/03/23/um/m-02164928.htm]</ref>

===Military integration===
[[Image:Ingreso Campo Skouriotissa.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus|UNFICYP]] San Martin Camp in [[Cyprus]]]]

Since 1990s, both militaries began a close defense cooperation and friendship policy. On September 1991 they signed together with Brazil, the Mendoza Declaration, which commits signatories not to use, develop, produce, acquire, stock, or transfer —directly or indirectly— [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] or [[biological warfare|biological]] weapons.

Joint exercises were established on an annual basis in the three armed forces alternately in Argentina and Chile territory. An example of such manoeuvres is the ''Patrulla Antártica Naval Combinada'' ({{lang-en|Joint Antarctic Naval Patrol}}) performed by both Navies to guarantee safety to all touristic and scientific ships that are in transit within the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

Both nations are highly involved in UN [[peacekeeping]] missions.

The asylum is rejected by all Chilean political forces,<ref name="Apablaza">[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1310106 El Gobierno da refugio al ex terrorista Apablaza]</ref> and by the Argentine political opposition forces.<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1306542 La UCR pidió la "inmediata" extradición de Apablaza]</ref> Some Argentine media and journalists<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxA7ZdOiERU Argentine journalist Jorge Lanata video]</ref> pointed out that the Argentine government ignored a ruling of the [[Argentine Supreme Court of Justice]] allowing the extradition of Apablaza.<ref name="Apablaza"/> The Chilean's lawyer of the State, Gustavo Gené, pointed out that there was no questioning of the Chilean legal system by the Argentine Commission, and that the reasons for granting political asylum were only "humanitarian".<ref>[http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2010/10/674-295808-9-gustavo-gene-no-hay-ningun-cuestionamiento-al-sistema-juridico-chileno.shtml Gustavo Gené: "No hay ningún cuestionamiento al sistema jurídico chileno"]</ref>
