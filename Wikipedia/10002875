If a person does something once (like wear a certain shirt before a test) and a good result occurs (like a good grade) it can become the "lucky exam shirt" to be worn to all tests even 30 years later.

This is undoubtedly going to be answered by someone with more expertise, but I do know the cool fact that when you get a kidney transplant, the new organ is placed in the body without removing the old organs; the old kidneys stay in place.

*Because [[Voltage]] and [[Electrical power]] aren't the same thing? Power is the "rate at which electrical energy is transmitted" and voltage is the "difference of electrical potential between two points of an electrical or electronic circuit".

== CCD arrrays ==

Isn't the output from a CCD array pretty much continuous such that shutter speed on a digital camera is pretty much a function of how many contiguous frames are recorded for a single snap shot? [[User:Leasing Agent|Diligent]] 17:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)
:No. A CCD can be used with a long exposure time, before reading it out. Of course, if a camera is built mainly for video, the designers might choose to use a fixed video-rate exposure time, in which case one would have to add images to simulate a longer exposure time, as you said. But still cameras are not made that way. --[[User:mglg|mglg]]<sub>([[User talk:mglg|talk]])</sub> 18:36, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

::::Thats odd. I would think electronic shutters superior to mechanical. Maybe its just a traditional thing. [[User:Leasing Agent|Diligent]] 06:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::The thing with electronic shutters is that they take up real estate on the CCD cell. Each photodiode that collects light has an accompanying ''shift register''. After the photodiodes have collected light for a specified time, their values are instantaneously copied (shifted) into the shift registers. The camera will then start reading the shift registers into memory. The camera can't read the photodiodes directly because that would take too long, and the diodes would keep on taking in light during that time.
:::::In contrast, a ''full frame'' CCD has no shift registers. A mechanical shutter stops light from coming in, and the camera can read the photodiodes directly, at its own leisurely pace. Because there are no shift registers the chip area can be used for photodiodes instead of register electronics, and so can have more pixels and better sensitivity.
:::::Maybe engineers will figure out better ways of putting in the shift registers, thereby closing the gap between electronic and mechanical shutters. Electronic shutters have nice features like lack of moving parts and the ability to capture video. For now, high end cameras have to do without those in order to get better image quality.

== Nocebo Effect ==

I have read both the [[placebo]] and [[nocebo]] articles, i am unsure of my understanding of the nocebo effect though. Is it a pill to make someone feel ill? Or is it the patients mentallity when taking a placebo (unknowingly), that it won't work, so it doesn't.

I am sorry if the question is worded badly, the whole thing is kind of a mess in my mind, thanks in advance for any answers.

:Arrgh, I lost my lengthy answer from network problems. In short, nocebo bills are like placebo pills. They shouldn't do any harm themselves. It's the patient's mentality when taking a nocebo pill that it will do harm, so harm comes. Not really from the pill, but from the patient's thinking. --'''[[User:Kjoonlee|Kjoon]]'''[[User talk:Kjoonlee|lee]] 20:33, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:The article says it's the reaction, not the pill or substance. It also says that the pill is called the same thing, whether it results in a helpful or harmful response. So you get a nocebo effect from a placebo. (If somebody tries to sell you "genuine nocebo pills", throw them away! Get the ''real'' fake pills.)

== [[Self-incompatibility in plants]] ==

Following a discussion in the Hebrew Wikipedia about whether or not each species should have its own article, the subject of the self-incompatibility article has also risen. Someone claims that this article should be split - as it relates to different mechanisms which are evolutionarily independent. One of the disadvantages of the current (merged) format, is that the S locus, described for different mechanisms in parallel, can be mistakenly conceived to consist of a single locus for all mechanisms. Do you think this article should be split? You are also welcome to state your opinion about the one species-one article idea, although Wikipedia's policy was already stated here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tree_of_Life#Article_titles_and_common_names].
