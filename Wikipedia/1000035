'''Carlo Ponti''' (11 December 1912 &ndash; 10 January 2007) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[film producer]] with over 140 production credits, and the husband of Italian movie star [[Sophia Loren]].

==Career==
Ponti was born in [[Magenta, Lombardy]] and studied law at the [[University of Milan]].  He joined his father's law firm in [[Milano|Milan]] and became involved in the film business through negotiating contracts.<ref name=independent>{{cite news

The film dealt with the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italian struggle against the Austrians]] for the inclusion of northeastern Italy into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Italy]] during the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. The film was successful, because it was easy to see "the Austrians as Germans" during [[World War II]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news| last =Martin|first =Douglas

Ponti accepted an offer from [[Lux Film]] in [[Rome]] in 1941, where he produced a series of commercially successful films featuring the comedian [[Totò]].<ref name=guardian>{{cite news

|accessdate =2007-01-14}}</ref> In [[1954 in film|1954]] he had his greatest artistic success with the production of [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La strada (film)|La strada]]''.  However, Fellini denied Ponti's role in its success and said that "La Strada was made in spite of Ponti and [[Dino De Laurentiis|De Laurentiis]]".<ref name=guardian/>  He produced [[Luchino Visconti|Visconti]]'s ''[[Boccaccio '70]]'' in [[1962 in film|1962]], ''[[Marriage Italian Style]]'' in [[1964 in film|1964]], and ''[[Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (film)|Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow]]'' in [[1965 in film|1965]].  He produced his most popular and financially successful film, [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (1965 film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' in [[1965 in film|1965]].  He subsequently produced three notable films with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], ''[[Blowup]]'' in [[1966 in film|1966]], ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' in [[1970 in film|1970]] and ''[[The Passenger (film)|The Passenger]]'' in [[1974 in film|1974]].

==Personal life==
In 1946 he married Giuliana Fiastri.<ref name=times>{{cite news |title =Carlo Ponti

He subsequently cast her in films such as ''[[Anna (1951 film)|Anna]]'' (1951). In 1952 his friend, Goffredo Lombardo, head of production at Titanus, changed Lazzaro's name to [[Sophia Loren]]. In 1957, Ponti obtained a [[Mexico|Mexican]] divorce from his first wife and married Sophia Loren by [[Proxy marriage|proxy]]. Divorce was still forbidden in Italy and he was informed that he would be charged with bigamy if he returned to Italy and Loren would be charged with "[[concubinage]]". Ponti co-produced several films in [[Hollywood]] starring Loren, establishing her fame, although most were box-office failures. In 1960 Ponti and Loren returned to Italy and when summoned to court, denied being married. Later, they had the marriage annulled in 1962, after which he arranged with his first wife, Giuliana, that the three of them move to France (which at that time allowed divorce) and become French citizens. In 1965 Giuliana Ponti divorced her husband, allowing Ponti to marry Loren in 1966 in a civil wedding in [[Sèvres, France|Sèvres]].<ref name=independent/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/sophialoren.htm

Two unsuccessful attempts were made to kidnap Ponti in 1975, including one involving an attack on his car with gunfire.<ref name=independent/>

Ponti was tried in absentia in 1979 for smuggling money and works of art abroad and fined 22 billion [[Italian lira|lire]] and sentenced to four years in prison. He did not attend the hearing, as his French nationality made him immune from extradition. He was finally cleared of the charges in 1990.<ref name=independent/>

==Death==
Ponti died in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]<ref name=nytimes/><ref name=Kansas/> from pulmonary complications. He was survived by Loren, his sons [[Carlo Ponti Jr|Carlo]] (now a music conductor and music director of the [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] Symphony<ref>{{cite web| title =San Bernardino Symphony Orchestra| publisher =San Bernardino Symphony Orchestra| date =2006-07| url =http://www.sanbernardinosymphony.org/| accessdate = 2007-01-14 }})</ref>), film producer Alessandro; film director and former child actor [[Edoardo Ponti]];<ref name=times/> and lawyer daughter Guendalina.<ref name=guardian/>
