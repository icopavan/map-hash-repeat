'''Robert Bruce Spencer''' (born 1962) is an American author and blogger best known for [[Criticism of Islam]] and research into [[Islamic terrorism]] and [[jihad]]. He has published [[Robert Spencer (author)#Bibliography|ten books]], including two ''New York Times'' bestsellers, and is a regular contributor to [[David Horowitz]]'s ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'' and ''[[Human Events]]''. In 2003, with sponsorship by [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]], he founded and has since directed [[Jihad Watch]], a blog which he describes as containing "...news of the international jihad, [and] commentary..."<ref name="lamb"/> which is dedicated to "bringing public attention to the role that jihad theology and ideology plays in the modern world, and to correcting popular misconceptions about the role of jihad and religion in modern-day conflicts".<ref name="Why Jihadwatch">{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/why-jihad-watch.html|title=Why Jihad Watch?|publisher=Jihad Watch|accessdate=June 17, 2011}}</ref> He has also co-founded [[Stop Islamization of America]] (SIOA) and the Freedom Defense Initiative with blogger [[Pamela Geller]], with whom he also co-authored a book, ''The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on America''.

==Background==
According to a 2010 interview in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, Spencer's father worked for the [[Voice of America]] during the [[Cold War]], and in his younger days, Spencer himself worked at Revolution Books, a [[Communist]] bookstore in [[New York City]] founded by [[Robert Avakian]].<ref name="Muhammad comes to">{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/67635/index2.html|title=Muhammad Comes to Manhattan|work=New York|author= Mark Jacobson|date=August 22, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}</ref> Spencer is a practicing [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Greek Catholic]].<ref name="Spencer bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/about-robert-spencer.html|title=About Robert Spencer|publisher=Jihad Watch|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Spero News">{{cite news|url=http://www.speroforum.com/a/42470/Pope-must-condemn-demonizing-of-Israel|title=Pope must condemn demonizing of Israel|last=Spencer|first=Robert|date=October 26, 2010|work=[[Spero News]]}}</ref> It is a rite of the [[Catholic Church]] whose adherents are, according to Spencer, "mostly concentrated in Lebanon and Syria, also in Jordan and the Palestinian territories."<ref name="lamb"/> He has said his grandparents were forced to emigrate from an area that is now part of Turkey because they were Christians.<ref name="lamb">{{cite web|url=http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1086|date=August 20, 2006|title=Robert Spencer Jihad Watch, Director Q & A with Brian Lamb|publisher=CSpan|accessdate=October 31, 2010}}</ref>

Spencer received a B.A. in 1983 and an M.A. in 1986 in [[religious studies]] from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. His masters thesis was on a Catholic history topic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcat.lib.unc.edu/search/aspencer%2C+robert/aspencer+robert/1%2C15%2C59%2CB/frameset&FF=aspencer+robert+bruce&1%2C1%2C|publisher=UNC-CH Libraries|work=Davis Library Thesis, Religion, 1986|title=The monophysite in the mirror, by Robert Bruce Spencer}}</ref> He has said he has been studying Islamic theology, law, and history on his own since 1980.<ref name="lamb"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trib.com/news/local/article_2428fa7c-c843-561b-80ac-b243218b92be.html |title=Marines gather to honor, celebrate |publisher=Trib.com |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> He worked in [[think tank]]s for more than 20 years,<ref name="Muhammad comes to"/> and in 2002–2003 did a stint as an adjunct fellow with the [[Free Congress Foundation]], an arm of the [[Heritage Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/about-robert-spencer.html |title=About Robert Spencer |publisher=Jihad Watch |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref><ref name="tribute">{{cite web | url= http://www.catholic.org/national/national_story.php?id=31171 | title=A Tribute: Paul Weyrich Has Died | date=December 19, 2008|accessdate=December 16, 2010| author= Robert Spencer|publisher=Catholic Online}}</ref> Spencer named [[Paul Weyrich]], also a Melkite Catholic, as a mentor of his writings on Islam. Spencer writes, "Paul Weyrich taught me a great deal, by word and by example&nbsp;– about how to deal both personally and professionally with the slanders and smears that are a daily aspect of this work."<ref name="tribute"/>  Spencer's first book on Islam was published in 2002.

==Spencer's views on Islam==
Spencer does not believe that traditional Islam is "inherently terroristic" but says he can prove that "traditional Islam contains violent and supremacist elements", and that "its various schools unanimously teach warfare against and the subjugation of unbelievers".<ref name="the last">{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/021661.php|title=''The Last Patriot'': Worse than Spencer's books!|publisher= www.jihadwatch.org|date=July 7, 2008}}</ref> However, he rejects the notion that all Muslims are necessarily violent people.<ref name="the last"/> He has said that among moderate Muslims, "there are some who are genuinely trying to frame a theory and practice of Islam that will allow for peaceful coexistence with unbelievers as equals."<ref name="what is moderate">{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/009791.php|title=What is a moderate Muslim?|publisher=Jihad Watch|author=Robert Spencer|date=January 14, 2006}}</ref> Spencer has also said he would welcome any Muslim who renounces [[jihad]] and [[dhimmitude]] to join in his "anti-jihadist efforts",<ref name="about Robert">{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/spencer/ |title=About Robert Spencer|publisher=Jihad Watch}}</ref> but feels that anyone pursuing his called-for reforms will face a difficult task, because "the radicals actually do have a stronger theoretical, theological, and legal basis within Islam for what they believe than the moderates do."<ref name="Hawkins interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.rightwingnews.com/interviews/spencer.php|title=An Interview With Robert Spencer|author=John Hawkins|publisher=Right Wing News}}</ref> He has also argued that many so-called reformers are not interested in genuine reform, but instead are aiming to deflect scrutiny of Islam.<ref name="what is moderate"/><ref name="Hawkins interview"/>

Spencer has expressed [[criticism of the Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and numerous other Muslim advocacy groups that he claims are closely tied to allegedly jihadist organizations such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/016754.php|title=CAIR "unindicted co-conspirator" in Hamas funding case|date=June 4, 2007|publisher=Jihad Watch}}</ref> He has also criticized the employment of several Muslims who were<ref>United States of America v. Randall Todd Royer, et al, United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, June 2003</ref> convicted on charges relating to terrorism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=26676|title=Cair's Continuing Mystery|publisher=Human Events|author=Robert Spencer|date=May 27, 2008}}</ref>

He has appeared with [[Ayn Rand Institute]] speakers on several occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ARIwatch.com/BirdsOfAFeather.htm |title=Birds of a Feather|publisher=Ariwatch.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> In an interview with the Washington Post he was "...asked if he was being deliberately combative and provocative, Spencer chuckled.

"It's fun."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/18/AR2010081802582_3.html?sid=ST2010081806973|title=In flap over mosque near Ground Zero, conservative bloggers gaining influence |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2010-12-15}}</ref>

Qur'an critic and secularist author [[Ibn Warraq]] has said that Spencer "tells the truth that few in the U.S. or Europe wish to face".<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_7RD2jwMU2wC&pg=PA271&dq=ibn+warraq+%22robert+spencer%22&client=firefox-a&cd=4#v=onepage&q=ibn%20warraq%20%22robert%20spencer%22&f=false |title=The politically incorrect guide to ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref>

[[Michelle Malkin]] says that Spencer "tells truths about jihadists that no one else will tell."<ref name="books.google.com"/> Conservative radio talk show host [[Dennis Prager]] has called JihadWatch, "one of most honorable Web sites that I know of monitoring jihad in the world today."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0707/31/pzn.01.html|title=Koran in the Toilet: Hate Crime?; Political Bedtime Stories|publisher=CNN|author=Paula Zahn|date=July 31, 2007}}</ref>

In a public debate between Spencer and [[Daniel C. Peterson]], a professor of Islamic Studies and Arabic, Peterson was critical about what he described as a selective criticism of Islam, but conceded to Spencer that "yes there is a broad consensus and has been for a long time about certain elements of jihadi teaching," about Spencer's assertion that the schools of Islamic jurisprudence do agree on the necessity to wage war against unbelievers, and that "we are really not disagreeing that much ... terrorism, Islamic terrorism, really does have roots in actual parts of the tradition of Islam."<ref>{{cite web|title=Islam: Threat or Not? - Part 4|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WX0hQeAbgs&feature=youtu.be&t=2m13s|publisher=JihadWatchVideo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Islam: Threat or Not? - Part 5|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NabkkJLqqOA&feature=youtu.be&t=2m55s|publisher=JihadWatchVideo}}</ref>

==Criticism==
Spencer's work has been criticized as showing "entrenched hostility" towards Islam,<ref name=arms>[[Karen Armstrong|Armstrong, Karen]]. [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4a05a4a4-f134-11db-838b-000b5df10621.html "Balancing the Prophet"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', April 27, 2007</ref> and condemned as hate speech by a number of Muslim-American and civil rights groups.<ref>''Censored 2004: The Top 25 Censored Stories'' Peter Phillips page 244</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeerah.info/News/2009/July/11%20n/Chicago%20Library%20Group%20Panelists%20Withdraw%20Over%20Role%20of%20Islam-Basher%20Robert%20Spencer.htm |title=Chicago Library Group Panelists Withdraw Over Role of Islam-Basher Robert Spencer|work=Al Jazeera|date=July 11, 2009|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}</ref>

[[Karen Armstrong]] criticized Spencer's citations of Islamic scripture as cherry-picked,<ref>{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Karen|title=Balancing the Prophet|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]| date =April 27, 2007|url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/4a05a4a4-f134-11db-838b-000b5df10621.html}}</ref> stating among other examples that "Spencer never cites the Koran's condemnation of all warfare as an 'awesome evil', its prohibition of aggression or its insistence that only self-defence justifies armed conflict..." She concludes that "His book is a gift to extremists who can use it to 'prove' ... that the west is incurably hostile to their faith." Spencer responds: "Yet the verse she quotes (2:217) actually says only that warfare during the 'sacred month' is an 'awesome evil' , and adds: 'Persecution is worse than killing.'" Spencer accuses Armstrong of context-dropping by omitting the fact that this was a defense for Muhammad's war in response to his persecution.<ref>{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Robert|title=Book adheres to historical record|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=May 5, 2007|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e1c8b5c2-faa5-11db-8bd0-000b5df10621.html#axzz1oLKRdJQF|retrieved=March 6, 2012}}</ref>

[[Benazir Bhutto]] accused Spencer of "falsely constructing a divide between Islam and West". She said he was using the Internet to spread hatred of Islam by presenting a "skewed, one-sided, and inflammatory story that only helps to sow the seed of civilizational conflict".<ref name="Bhutto">Benazir Bhutto, ''Reconciliation: Islam, Democracy, and the West'', Harper, 2008, pp. 245-6</ref>

[[Dinesh D'Souza]], of the [[Hoover Institution]], wrote that Spencer downplays the passages of the Quran that urge peace and goodwill to reach one-sided opinions. He contends that Spencer applies a moral standard to Muslim empires that could not have been met by any European empire.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://newsbloggers.aol.com/2007/03/02/letting-bin-laden-define-islam/|title=Letting Bin Laden Define Islam|author= Dinesh D'Souza|date=January 17, 2009}}</ref>

In an article discussing [[Bat Ye'or]]'s 2005 book ''[[Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis]]'', French academic historian Ivan Jablonka refers to  Spencer, saying he has made a specialty of denouncing Islamist threats and quoting Spencer's own review of ''Eurabia'' as criticizing Europe for "selling its soul to the devil 'in exchange for markets{{'"}}.<ref name="online version">Ivan Jablonka, [http://www.laviedesidees.fr/La-peur-de-l-islam.html "''La peur de l’islam.

Spencer co-founded [[Stop Islamization of America]] (SIOA) and the Freedom Defense Initiative (FDI) with [[Pamela Geller]]. Both organizations are designated as [[hate group]]s by the [[Anti-defamation league]]<ref>[http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/sioa.htm "Backgrounder: Stop Islamization of America (SIOA)"].

==Controversies==
On December 20, 2006, the government of [[Pakistan]] announced a ban on Spencer's book, ''[[The Truth About Muhammad]]'', citing "objectionable material" as the cause.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.kuna.net.kw/Home/Story.aspx?Language=en&DSNO=936032 |title= Pakistan bans Roberts' book about Prophet Muhammad}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref> Former Pakistani prime minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] was likewise highly critical of Spencer's work.<ref name="Bhutto" /> In his response to Bhutto's criticism, Spencer notes that the passage she cites was in fact written by [[Ibn Warraq]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/2008/03/parting-words-from-benazir-bhutto.html | title=Parting Words from Benazir Bhutto}}</ref>

In 2009, Spencer was asked to participate in an information session about Islam and Muslims designed for ethnic and multicultural librarians entitled "Perspectives on Islam: Beyond the Stereotyping", at the 2009 annual meeting of the [[American Library Association]], which was sponsored by the ALA's Ethnic & Multicultural Information Exchange Round Table (EMIERT). After objections were raised by ALA members and the general public, the three other panelists withdrew in protest and the session was ultimately canceled.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALA Conference 2009: Panelists Quit Session Featuring 'Islam Basher{{'-}}|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6670156.html|work=Library Journal|accessdate=June 11, 2011|author=Raya Kuzyk|coauthors=Norman Oder|date=July 11, 2009}}</ref> 

In March 2010, Spencer endorsed the [[English Defence League]] (EDL) saying that "The EDL is standing up to violent thugs from both the Left and the increasingly assertive Islamic communities in Britain, and they deserve the support of all free people."<ref>{{cite web|author=Spencer, Robert|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/2010/03/uk-fascist-anti-fascists-attack-anti-jihad-demonstrators.html |title=UK: Fascist 'anti-fascists' attack anti-jihad demonstrators |publisher=Jihad Watch|date=March 21, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}</ref> The EDL has been described as a hate group by various British  organizations, such as [[Searchlight Magazine]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Lowles|first=Nick|title=The growing Islamophobic international|url=http://www.searchlightmagazine.com/pages/StoryTemplatePrint.php?story=334|publisher=Searchlight Magazine|accessdate=June 26, 2011|month=September|year=2010}}</ref> and the Jewish [[Community Security Trust]].<ref>{{cite web|last=CST|title=Don't be fooled by Islamophobia|url=http://thecst.org.uk/blog/?p=963|publisher=Community Security Trust|accessdate=June 26, 2011|date=November 30, 2009}}</ref>  

In August 2010 ''The Washington Post'' cited Spencer, along with [[Pamela Geller]] as conservative bloggers who have been influential in challenging the construction of the [[Park51]] project,  which he calls the "Ground Zero mosque".<ref name="Flap over mosque">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/18/AR2010081802582.html?sid=ST2010081806973|title=In flap over mosque near Ground Zero, conservative bloggers gaining influence|author=Michelle Boorstein|date=August 19, 2010|work=The Washington Post}}</ref> Spencer and Geller's organization [[Stop Islamization of America]] launched their first public protest outside of the Park51 location on June 6, 2010.

Adam Serwer, writing in [[The American Prospect]] countered that Spencer's evidence for this accusation was insufficient, and criticized Spencer's conclusions regarding Rauf's comments on the practice of Shariah by American Muslims. Serwer asked Rauf to clarify, and the latter responded that "...there are aspects of Sharia law that we are allowed to practice. Like Jews practice their dietary laws, we practice them without contradiction."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sewer|first=Adam|title=Spencer's (Still) Tenuous Evidence|url=http://prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=06&year=2010&base_name=spencers_still_tenuous_evidenc|accessdate=June 26, 2011|date=June 14, 2010}}</ref> The non-partisan [[FactCheck]] also found no evidence of Rauf's supposed radicalism, stating that "Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf has a long history of cooperation with the U.S. government, beginning during the Bush administration", and that supposedly anti-American comments made by him were "...taken out of context".<ref>{{cite web|title=Questions About the 'Ground Zero Mosque'|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2010/08/questions-about-the-ground-zero-mosque/|publisher=FactCheck.org|accessdate=June 27, 2011|date=August 25, 2010}}</ref> 

In an October 2010 news article, an investigative report by ''[[The Tennessean]]'' found that "IRS filings from 2008 show that Robert Spencer earned $132,537 from the David Horowitz Freedom Center, and Horowitz pocketed over $400,000 for himself in just one year". <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101024/NEWS01/10240374/Anti-Muslim-crusaders-make-millions-spreading-fear|title=Anti-Muslim crusaders make millions spreading fear|date=October 24, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/assets/pdf/DN1658821023.PDF|title=David Horowitz Freedom Center's IRS Form 990|date=June 3, 2009|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}</ref> 

In September 2010, on ABC's ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' show, [[Reza Aslan]] said that SIOA is an offshoot of [[SIOE]], which he said had been referred to as a neo-Nazi organization by the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Should Americans Fear Islam? pt.3|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dCHm_H0c1U&feature=youtu.be&t=13m40s|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref> Spencer later challenged Aslan to produce any evidence of his claim.<ref>{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Robert|title=Why is Reza Aslan taken seriously?|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/2010/10/questions-for-reza-aslan.html|publisher=Jihad Watch|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=June 18, 2011}}</ref>
