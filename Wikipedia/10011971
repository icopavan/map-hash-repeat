'''Final (3/11/4); Ended Tues, 13 March 2007 02:32(UTC)'''

{{User|Bouncingmolar}} - I started to use wikipedia december 05, and have since become hooked after discovering the Dentistry pages which were very primitive at the time, while answering dental questions on yahoo answers. The large majority of my contributions have been aimed at restructuring and creating pages in the dentistry section. I also wikignome when I see anything on any of my wiki diversions and obsessively revert any discovery of vandalism. The main contributions I would make would be to assist administration in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Dentistry|dentistry project]] pages. The majority of pages i monitor fall under the dentistry category, so I can review them. However I  consider general anti vandalism as one of my priorities - [[User:Bouncingmolar|Bouncingmolar]] 12:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:''Candidate, please indicate acceptance of the nomination here:'' <s>I accept - [[User:Bouncingmolar|Bouncingmolar]] 13:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</s> I will be back after a few more thousand then :) [[User:Bouncingmolar|Bouncingmolar]] 23:49, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<!--The candidate may make an optional statement here-->
I admit I don't spend all my time on wikipedia, and maybe i do look a bit like a maggot. I do ''try'' to keep my life balanced. In regards to XFDs, although I would like to resolve XFDs they are not my main priority. My main interest would be administration in the Dentistry area, I watch all the dentistry articles i have found, and not all of them need to be changed. jimbo wales (whoever he is), says its not a big deal. I think the quality of my contributions shows that I am responsible enough to hold a mop. I don't plan to go out and slop it over the entire contents of wikipedia, but I can still make a difference, even if my mop wouldn't be as big as others.


;Questions for the candidate
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia in this capacity. Please take the time to answer a few generic questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What sysop chores do you anticipate helping with? Please check out [[:Category:Administrative backlog]], and read the page about [[Wikipedia:administrators|administrators]] and the [[Wikipedia:administrators' reading list|administrators' reading list]].
::'''A:''' The main sysop chores I am interested in is administration of the dentistry section (eg helping users merge or move information and facilitate resolving disputes). However I am very keen to help with anti vandalism efforts. At the moment when I discover vandals, I always check their past contributions to form a picture of the type of editing they do and report when i think appropriate. I would also participate in the wikipedia Categories for discussion.

:'''2.''' Of your articles or contributions to Wikipedia, are there any with which you are particularly pleased, and why?
::'''A:''' I am proud of my contributions to the [[:category:Dentistry|Dentistry]] category. In particular, [[apthous ulcer]] and [[oral ulcer]], also the sub pages of [[dental auxiliary]] also [[Dental restorations]] and [[dental restorative materials]]. I am particularly proud of these ones because they required merging of information or separation and in the case of dental restorations, there was much discussion as to what the solution for the merger would be. 

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' I couldn't say that I have been in any heated conflicts, but I think that is partly because my contributions and conflicts are either neutral and because they are usually resolved by civil discussion using logic to reach a solution. 

'''Optional Questions'''
:'''4.''' In your RfA, you say that you've been here since 2005, but your edit history suggests that you have only been editing continuously since February 9, 2007.  You did have a few days of activity in June 2006, July 2006, and December 2005.  There is nothing wrong with long gaps (I have them too), but why should we not evaluate you as an editor who has been here for just over a month?  --'''[[User:Selket|Selket]]''' <sup>[[User_talk:Selket|Talk]]</sup> 15:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:'''  An administrator is a normal user who the community views to be responsible enough to use the extra tools productively. I consider my self to be a responsible user, I admit I do have other responsibilities in my life which may create gaps in my editing. But I think that the quality of my contributions should count more than the number of thousands. I  also referred to when I started only to tell you about myself. Administrators are just normal users with a mop and a bucket. I think I can make a fair and positive contribution with a mop especially as part of the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Dentistry|dentistry project]]

'''Discussion'''

'''Support'''
#'''Support''' - I'm fed up with editcountitis. Any user in good standing who wants admin tools should get them. Period. Why should less than 1000 edits disqualify this user for adminship? <font face="Verdana">[[User:Walton_monarchist89|<font color="Purple">'''Wal'''</font>]][[User talk:Walton_monarchist89|<font color="silver">'''ton'''</font>]] <small><sup><font color="Purple">[[WP:BRoy|Vivat Regina!]]</font></sup></small></font> 20:44, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
#'''Support''' - Ridiculous.  I ask all of you to read the ''Nomination Standards'' section of this page.  "The only major consideration for whether a user should become an administrator is evidence of how the user will use administrator tools."  Granting a user with less than 1000 edits does not somehow dilute the quality of administrators.  Jimbo Wales himself has stated that Adminship is not a big deal.  The number of edits a person has does not correlate to his experience.  Please reconsider your opposition if it is solely based on edit count.  [[User:Kntrabssi|Kntrabssi]] 21:01, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
#: Not knowing who Jimbo Wales is surely shows a huge lack of knowledge regarding even the basic working of Wikipedia, nevermind the more intricate workings of such things as the blocking/banning policy. <span style="font-size:95%">-- [[User:Nick|<font color="red">'''Nick'''</font>]]<sup> [[User talk:Nick|<font color="blue">'''t'''</font>]]</sup></span> 21:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

#'''Oppose''' less than 1000 edits in the main spaces, sporadic contributions - why the long series of gaps in your Wiki-career? General lack of admin-related tasks on your cv, too. Best to withdraw this application and return when more admin-related experience has been gathered. [[User talk:(aeropagitica)|(aeropagitica)]] 16:03, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''', under 1000 edits, a huge wikibreak splitting them in half. Try ocntributing more to wikispace.--[[User:Wizardman|<span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span>]] 16:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

#::''___further comments come after retracting my acceptance (see time of retraction)___'' [[User:Bouncingmolar|Bouncingmolar]] 00:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' While the total edit count is disturbingly low, I accept that this is not necessarily a bar to adminship. But I would suggest that only 29 edits in wikipedia and 3 in wikitalk is. We have to be assured that you are aware of, and can implement, policy, which these edit figures do not indicate to me. As to the "Jimbo Wales" comment, while a newish editor may not know the name, the very fact that the name was brought up might well have suggested that, before making a profession of ignorance, you should actively find out who he is. And while not knowing who he is is perhaps ok, not troubling to find out is alarming.--[[User:Anthony.bradbury|Anthony.bradbury]] 00:21, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

#'''Oppose''' - less than 1000 edits is not enough to know how to use tools. Come back in a few months after you have at least 3000 edits. [[User:Patstuart|Patstuart]]<sup>[[User_talk:Patstuart|talk]]·[[Special:contributions/Patstuart|edits]]</sup> 00:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' Too little experience. [[User:Mike 7|Michael]] 00:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' Extremely bad grammar and use of capital letters. Plus, I've got more edits than you and I don't think I'm anywhere near ready to try for adminship.

#::: Thanks for your late comments captain. I'm not sure what you're referring to. However I think that loose comparisons to your editing style are irrelevant.[[User:Bouncingmolar|Bouncingmolar]] 02:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

'''Neutral'''
#'''Neutral''' not as active as I'd like to see, not enough experience to go closing XFDs (only 23 edits in wiki-space) and finding it hard to see a real need for the tools.  However, general contribution is good, keep doing it and become more familiar with XFDs and try RFA again in a while.  [[User:The Rambling Man|The Rambling Man]] 16:38, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
#'''Neutral'''Experience issues. [[User_talk:Evilclown93 | The Evil Clown]] 20:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
#'''Neutral'''.  I've seen Bouncingmolar do some good work with the dentistry project on dentistry-related articles.  Bouncingmolar is a quality Wikipedian who makes good contributions.  I'm not convinced, however, the Bouncingmolar has the requisite policy knowledge to be effective as an administrator.  I recommend withdrawal, increased participation in policy-intensive areas like [[WP:AFD|AFD]], and a second try again in several months. · '''<font color="#709070">[[User:Jersyko|j e r s y k o]]</font>''' ''<font color="#007BA7" size="1">[[User talk:Jersyko|talk]]</font>'' · 22:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
