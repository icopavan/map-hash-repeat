'''Santa María del Tule''' is a town and a municipality in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Oaxaca]]. 
It is part of the [[Centro District, Oaxaca|Centro District]] in the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Valles Centrales region]].
It is located {{convert|11|km|mi|sp=us}} SE of the  [[Oaxaca (city)|city of Oaxaca]] on Highway 190, passing the city and ruins of [[Mitla]].<ref name="MexDesOax">{{cite journal |last= Quintanar Hinojosa |first=Beatriz  |year=2007 |month= August |title=Sta. María del Tule y Mitla |journal=Guía México Desconocido: Oaxaca |volume= 137  |pages=28–29  |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx }}</ref> The town and municipality are named for the patron saint of the place, the [[Virgin Mary]] and “Tule” comes from the [[Náhuatl]] word “tulle” or “tullin” which means [[Schoenoplectus|bulrush]].<ref name="encmuc">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20409a.htm |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Oaxaca Santa María de Tule |accessdate=2008-02-22 |work= }}</ref>  

The town’s claim to fame is as the home of a 2,000 year old [[Taxodium mucronatum|Montezuma cypress]] tree, known as the [[El Árbol del Tule]], which is one of the oldest, largest and widest trees in the world. Its gnarled trunk and branches are filled with shapes that have been given names such as “the elephant,” “the pineapple” and even one called “[[Carlos Salinas de Gortari|Carlos Salinas’]] ears.”<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="planeta">{{cite web |url=http://www.planeta.com/ecotravel/mexico/oaxaca/tule.html |title= Celebrating the Tule Tree |first=Ron |last=Mader |publisher=Planeta.com |accessdate=2009 December 11 }}</ref><ref name="chairez">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/7204-Arbol-del-Tule-(Oaxaca) |title=Arbol del Tule (Oaxaca) |first=Arturo |last= Chairez  |month=April |year=2000 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Tule Tree (Oaxaca) |accessdate=2009 December 11 }}</ref>

==History==

The municipality of Santa María del Tule used to be a lake surrounded by marshes which included cypress trees.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="planeta"/> This marsh was also filled with bulrushes which accounts for part of the town’s name.<ref name="planeta"/> The population of Tule had made their living since pre-Hispanic times extracting and processing [[calcium oxide|lime (calcium oxide)]] for sale in the city of Oaxaca.  In 1926, much of the municipality was made [[ejido]] land, and much of the population became farmers, growing corn, beans, [[chickpeas]] and [[alfalfa]], mostly during the rainy season in the summer.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Over the centuries, the area has dried with the lake and marshes gone.<ref name="encmuc"/> More recently, increased urbanization and irrigated farming has put pressure on aquifers here. During the dry season, the water table decreases more than six meters. This drop in water tables threatens the survival of the remaining cypress trees in the area.<ref name="planeta"/>

==The town==

The small town of Santa María del Tule appears to be built around one particularly large cypress tree with its crafts market, church and town plaza all next to it.<ref name="moon">{{cite web |url= http://www.moon.com/destinations/oaxaca/oaxaca-valley/east-textile-route/santa-maria-del-tule |title= Santa María del Tule  |publisher=Moon Handbooks |accessdate=2009 December 11 }}</ref> The La Guadalupana Market serves traditional Oaxacan dishes of the area including barbacoa and empanadas de Amarillo. The area is also noted for its ice cream which includes flavors such as cactus fruit, leche quemada (literally burnt milk) as well as specialties known as Beso de Angel (angel kiss) and Beso Oaxaqueño (Oaxacan kiss).<ref name="planeta"/>

The town’s [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]]-style church is called ''El Templo de Santa María de la Asunción'' (Temple of the [[Assumption of Mary|Virgin Mary of the Assumption]]) and dates from the 18th century.<ref name="MexDesOax"/> It was built of stone over an ancient pagan shrine, and is surrounded by other buildings and areas belonging to the parish. A large walled plaza lies in front of the church.<ref name="unesco">{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1594/ |title=Santa Maria del Tule |publisher=UNESCO |location=New York |accessdate=2009 December 11 }}</ref>

Major celebrations here include Candelaria on 2 February, the Feast of the Assumption of Mary on 15 August and the Festival of the Tule Tree on the second Monday of October.<ref name="encmuc"/>

==The Tule Tree==
{{main|Árbol del Tule}}
[[File:ArbordeTuleOaxaca MX.jpg|right|thumb|Tule Tree]]
This tree is one of a number of old Montezuma cypress (''[[Taxodium mucronatum]]'') trees that grow in the town.<ref name="planeta"/> This particular tree is found in the town’s center growing in both the town’s main plaza and the atrium of the church of Santa María de la Asunción.<ref name="artes">{{cite web |url= INAH http://www.arts-history.mx/banco/index.php?id_nota=22062004111520 |title= El árbol del Tule en Oaxaca, único en su especie en el mundo |publisher=Artes e Historia INAH |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=The Tule Tree, the unique in its species in the world |accessdate=2009 December 11 }}</ref><ref name="mexmax">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicomaxico.org/Tule/tule.htm |title=El Arbol de Santa María del Tula en Oaxaca, México |first= Manuel |last= Aguirre Botello  |month=December |year=2001 |publisher=Mexico Maxico |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=The Tree of Santa Maria del Tule in Oaxaca, Mexico |accessdate=2009 December 11  }}</ref>

The tree is one of the oldest and largest in the world and has the widest girth.<ref name="planeta"/><ref name="mexmax"/> It has an age of at least 2,000 years, with its existence chronicled by both the [[Aztecs]] and the Spanish that founded the city of Oaxaca.<ref name="unesco"/><ref name="artes"/> It has a height of forty meters, a volume of between 700 and 800m3,  an estimated weight of 630 tons and a diameter of about forty meters.<ref name="planeta"/><ref name="chairez"/><ref name="mexmax"/><ref name="playas">{{cite web |url=http://www.playasmexico.com.mx/articulo_playas.php?id_article=537 |title= Árbol de Santa María del Tule, Oaxaca  |publisher=Playas de Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=The Tree of Santa Maria del Tule, Oaxaca |accessdate=2009 December 11 }}</ref>  The trunk is so wide that thirty people with arms extended joining hands are needed to encircle it.<ref name="mexmax"/> The tree dwarfs the town’s main church and its taller than its spires,<ref name="planeta"/><ref name="unesco"/> and it is still growing.<ref name="chairez"/>

To the indigenous peoples of this area, the tree was sacred.<ref name="unesco"/> According to [[Mixtec]] myth, people originated from cypress tress, which were considered sacred and a genus. This particular tree was the site of a ritual which included the sacrifice of a dove and was realized for the last time in 1834.<ref name="aqui">{{cite web |url=http://www.aquioaxaca.com/aqui02/?q=node/182 |title= Santa Maria del Tule |author=Gabriel |date=2006-03-10 |publisher=Aquí Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-12-11 }}</ref> According to [[Mixe]] myth, the origin of this particular tree is the walking stick of a god or a king by the name of Conday, who stuck his walking stick, supposedly weighting 62 kilos, into the ground which he rested. From that point on, the tree began to grow, and according to the king version of the story, the king died the same day the tree began to grow.<ref name="planeta"/><ref name="playas"/>  The tree has gnarled branches and trunk, and various local legends relate to what appear to be animals and other shapes growing in the tree.<ref name="unesco"/> Today, these forms have names such as “the elephant,” “the lion,” “the Three Kings,” “the deer”, “the pineapple,” “the fish,”<ref name="encmuc"/> “the squirrel’s tail” and “Carlos Salinas’ears.” Local guides point out the shapes using pocket mirrors to reflect the sun.<ref name="planeta"/>

This kind of cypress is known in Spanish as a sabino, in Nahuatl as an ahuehuete and in [[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]] as Yagaguichiciña, and it is Mexico’s national tree.<ref name="planeta"/> This particular tree was photographed for the first time by Désiré Charney in 1856 and was described and measured by José Acosta in “Historia Natural y Moral de las Indias” in 1856.<ref name="aqui"/> The tree has been nominated by SEMARNAP as the most notable tree in Oaxaca,<ref name="mexmax"/> and is listed with the  Lista Indicative del Patrimonio de Mexico (Indicative List of the Patrimony of Mexico).<ref name="artes"/>

The tree was in danger of drying out in the late 19th century but since then it has been regularly watered.<ref name="artes"/>

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, Tule has governing authority over the following communities: Güendulain, Kilómetro Dieciséis Punto Cinco, and Paraje el Corralito,<ref name="INEGI">{{cite web |url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009 December 11 }}</ref> which cover an area of 25.2km2.<ref name="encmuc"/> The total population of the municipality is 8,259, of which 7,831 or 95% live in the town proper.<ref name="INEGI"/>  The municipality borders the municipalities of [[Tlalixtac de Cabrera]], [[Rojas de Cuauhtémoc]],  [[San Francisco Lachigoló]], [[Teotitlán del Valle]] and [[Santa Cruz Amilpas]]. The main river here is the [[Atoyac River|Atoyac]] and the area has a mild climate with little seasonal variation in temperatures. Vegetation is principally [[mesquite]] and [[Leucaena leucocephala|leucaena]] as well as the famous cypress trees in the municipal seat. Animal life is mostly small mammals such as the red squirrel, field mouse and [[opossum]] and birds such as the buzzard and duck.<ref name="encmuc"/>

The main economic base is tourism based on the Tule tree, employing nearly 75% of the municipality’s population. The main agriculture product today is the [[guava]] fruit, with some corn and beans still grown, but this employs only nine percent of the population. Some processing of the guava fruit occurs here, as well as crafts such as pottery.<ref name="encmuc"/>
