[[Genocide]] is the deliberate and systematic destruction, in whole or in part, of an ethnic, racial, religious, or national group. It is defined in Article 2 of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (CPPCG) as "any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, [[ethnicity|ethnical]]<!--"ethnical" is quoted from the document; although unusual, it is found in several dictionaries-->, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[religion|religious]] group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the groups conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."<ref name=CPPCG>[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/genocide.htm Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Note: "ethnical", although unusual, is found in several dictionaries]</ref>

The preamble to the CPPCG not only states that "genocide is a crime under [[international law]], contrary to the spirit and aims of the [[United Nations]] and condemned by the civilized world", but that "at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity".<ref name=CPPCG/>

Determining what historical events constitute a ''genocide'' and which are merely criminal or inhuman behavior is not a clear-cut matter. In nearly every case where accusations of genocide have circulated, partisans of various sides have fiercely disputed the interpretation and details of the event, often to the point of promoting wildly different versions of the facts. An accusation of genocide is certainly not taken lightly and will almost always be controversial. The following list of genocides and alleged genocides should be understood in this context and cannot be regarded as the final word on these subjects.

Much of the debate about genocides revolves around the proper definition of the word "genocide". The exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists, for example M. Hassan Kakar in his book ''The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982''<ref name=HassanKakar-Index>M. Hassan Kakar ''[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft7b69p12h&brand=eschol Afghanistan: The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982] [[University of California]] press © 1995 The Regents of the University of California.</ref> argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted,<ref name=HassanKakar-13-GTC>M.

Some critics of the current definition of genocide under international law have also argued that the definition was partly influenced by [[Joseph Stalin]], and that this is the reason why it does not include political groups.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Robert Gellately & Ben Kiernan |title=The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2003|isbn=0521527503 | page= [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ay76mYBLU3sC&pg=PA267&dq=where+Stalin+was+presumably+anxious+to+avoid+his+purges+being+subjected+to+genocidal+scrutiny&ie=ISO-8859-1 267]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Staub, Ervin |title=The Roots of Evil: The Origins of Genocide and Other Group Violence |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year= |isbn=0-521-42214-0 |page=[http://books.google.com/books?id=29u-vt_KgGEC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=genocide+political+economic+groups+soviet+union#PPA8,M1 8]}}</ref>

According to [[R. J. Rummel]], genocide has 3 different meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by a government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This also includes actions that are not actually killings but tend to eliminate the group, such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group. A generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder. It is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that Rummel created the term [[democide]] for the third meaning.<ref>[http://www.Hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM Domocide versus genocide; which is what?]</ref>

==Timeline of genocides==
===Before 1490===
Adam Jones explains, in his book ''Genocide: A Comprehensive Introduction'', that people throughout history have always had the ability to see other groups as alien; he quotes Chalk and Jonassohn: "Historically and anthropologically peoples have always had a name for themselves. In a great many cases, that name meant 'the people' to set the owners of that name off against all other people who were considered of lesser quality in some way. If the differences between the people and some other society were particularly large in terms of religion, language, manners, customs, and so on, then such others were seen as less than fully human: pagans, savages, or even animals. (Chalk and Jonassohn, ''The History and Sociology of Genocide'', p.&nbsp;28.)"<ref name=Jones-3.4>Adam Jones [[#References|References]] p. 3, footnote 4</ref>

Jones continues by saying that the less a people have in common with another group the easier it is for the aliens to be defined as less than human and from there it is but a short step to an argument that says if they are a threat, then they should "be eliminated in order that we may live (Them or us)."<ref name=Jones-3.5>Adam Jones p.3 footnote 5 cites Helen Fein, ''Genocide: A Sociological Perspective'', (London: Sage, 1993), p. 26</ref>  But after making this assessment Jones continues "The difficulty, as Frank Chalk and Kurt Jonassohn pointed out in their early study, is that such historical records as exist are ambiguous and undependable. While history today is generally written with some fealty to 'objective' facts, most previous accounts aimed rather to praise the writer's patron (normally the leader) and to emphasize the superiority of one's own gods and religious beliefs."<ref name=Jones-3>Adam Jones [[#References|References]] p. 3</ref>

Scholars of antiquity differentiate between genocide and [[gendercide]], in which males were killed but the children (particularly the girls) and women were incorporated into the conqueror's society. Jones notes that "Chalk and Jonassohn provide a wide-ranging selection of historical events such as the [[Assyrian Empire]]'s root-and branch depredations in the first half of the first millennium BCE, and the destruction of [[Melos]] by [[Athens]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (fifth century BCE), a gendercidal rampage described by [[Thucydides]] in his '[[Melian Dialogue]]'."<ref name=Jones-5>Adam Jones [[#References|References]] p. 5</ref>

[[Ran Min]] (died 352) is mostly known for his famous order to execute all of the [[Wu Hu]].

A [[massacre]] was said to have been committed by [[Xue Rengui]] (614–683) against the [[Tiele people]].

Konraad Elst stated that:
For its sheer magnitude in scope and death toll, coupled with its occasional (though not continuous) intention to exterminate entire Hindu communities, the Islamic campaign against Hinduism, which was never fully called off since the first naval invasion in 636 CE, can without exaggeration be termed genocide. To quote Will Durant's famous line: "The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex of order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within."

From the 1490s when [[Christopher Columbus]] set foot on the Americas to the 1890 massacre of [[Sioux]] at [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] by the United States military, the [[indigenous population]] of the Western Hemisphere may have declined, the direct cause mostly from disease, to 1.8 from as many as 100 million.<ref name=DS-Review>Staff.

Some historians argue that genocide, a crime of intent, was not the intent of European colonization while in America. The Reverend [[Stafford Poole]], a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priest, wrote: "There are other terms to describe what happened in the Western Hemisphere, but genocide is not one of them. It is a good [[propaganda]] term in an age where slogans and shouting have replaced reflection and learning, but to use it in this context is to cheapen both the word itself and the appalling experiences of the [[Jews]] and [[Armenian Genocide|Armenians]], to mention but two of the major victims of this century."<ref>Stafford Poole, quoted in Royal, p.&nbsp;63.</ref>

In his book ''American Holocaust'', [[David Stannard]] argues that the destruction of the aboriginal peoples of the Americas, in a "string of genocide campaigns" by Europeans and their descendants, was the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world.<ref name=DS-Review/><ref>[[David Stannard]] (1992). ''American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-508557-4. "During the course of four centuries - from the 1490s to the 1890s - Europeans and white Americans engaged in an unbroken string of genocide campaigns against the native peoples of the Americas." ([http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Pestilence_AH.html p.147]). "[It] was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world."([http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/History/Prologue_AH.html Prologue])</ref> Stannard's perspective has been further refined by [[Ward Churchill]], who has said "it was precisely malice, not nature, that did the deed."<ref>http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2006/05/ward_churchills_going_down_2.php</ref> Stannard's claim of 100 million deaths has been challenged because he does not cite any demographic evidence to support this number, and because he makes no distinction between death from violence and death from disease.

According to Noble David Cook, "There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact."<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Born to die: disease and New World conquest, 1492-1650'', p. 9.</ref>

Authors such as the [[Holocaust]] expert [[David Cesarani]] have argued that the government and policies of the United States of America against certain indigenous peoples in furtherance of [[Manifest destiny]] constituted genocide.

=====Argentina=====
{{Main|Conquest of the Desert|Paraguayan War}}

The [[Conquest of the Desert]] was a military campaign directed mainly by General [[Julio Argentino Roca]] in the 1870s, which established Argentine dominance over [[Patagonia]], which was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Argentina|indigenous peoples]], leaving more than 1,300 indigenous dead.<ref>Carlos A. Floria and César A. García Belsunce, 1971. ''Historia de los Argentinos'' I and II; ISBN 84-599-5081-6. {{Page needed|date=December 2008}}</ref>

Jens Andermann has noted that the contemporary sources on that campaign indicate that it was a genocide by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] government against the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#Argentina|indigenous tribes]].<ref>[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/llc/subjects/span_lat_amer/span_lat_amer_staff/ja Andermann, Jens].

The [[Black War]] was a period of conflict between the [[Great Britain|British]] colonists and [[Tasmanian Aborigine]]s in [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) in the early years of the 19th century. The conflict, in combination with introduced diseases and other factors, had such devastating impact on the Tasmanian Aboriginal population that it was reported the Tasmanian Aborigines had been exterminated.<ref name="Bonwick01">Bonwick, James (1870) ''The black war of Van Diemen's Land'' London : S.

In 1986 Reynald Secher wrote a controversial book entitled: ''A French Genocide: The Vendée'', in which he argued that the actions of the French republican government during the revolt in the Vendée (1793–1796), a popular mostly Catholic uprising against the anti-clerical Republican government during the [[French Revolution]], was the first modern genocide.<ref name="SR-Vendée">Secher, Reynald.

Concerning the controversy, Michel Vovelle, a specialist on the French Revolution, remarked: "A whole literature is forming on "Franco-French genocide", starting from risky estimates of the number of fatalities in the Vendean wars: 128,000, 400,000... and why not 600,000?

In an article "We Charge Genocide: A Brief History of US in the Philippines" that appeared in the December 2005 issue of ''Political Affairs'' (an online magazine that bills itself, "Marxist Thought Online"), [[E. San Juan, Jr.]], director of the Philippines Cultural Studies Center, Connecticut, argued that during the [[Philippine-American War]] (1899–1902) and pacification campaign (1902–1913), the operations launched by the U.S. against the Filipinos, an integral part of its pacification program, which claimed the lives of over a million Filipinos, constituted genocide.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/articleview/2274/1/134/ |title=We Charge Genocide: A Brief History of US in the Philippines|author=[[E.

In November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the ''Philadelphia Ledger'' reported: "The present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog...."<ref>quoted in ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'' (1980), [[Howard Zinn]], Harper & Row.

[[Gore Vidal]], in an exchange of letters in the ''New York Review of Books'' about the Philippines campaign says, discussing General [[J. Franklin Bell]]'s own reporting that American troops were responsible for 600,000 dead men, women, and children on the island of [[Luzon]] alone, "If this is not a policy of genocide (no dumb letters on the dictionary meaning of the word), it will do until the real thing comes along."<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/6787 ''New York Review of Books''], Volume 28, Number 20, December 17, 1981</ref>

====Ireland====
=====War of the Three Kingdoms=====

{{See also|Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Cromwellian Plantation}}

Towards the end of the [[War of the Three Kingdoms]] (1639–1651) the English [[Rump Parliament]] sent the [[New Model Army]] to Ireland to subdue and take revenge on the Catholic population of the country and to prevent [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] loyal to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] from using Ireland as a base to threaten England. Initially under the command of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and later under other [[roundhead|parliamentary]] generals, the New Model army carried this out. Coupled to the war aim of securing the country for the English Parliament were several other interrelated objectives. Punitive confiscation of the lands of Irish families involved in fighting the parliamentary forces was implemented . This became a continuation of the Elizabethan policy of encouraging Protestant settlement of Ireland, because New Model army soldiers—Protestant to a man and who were owed considerable back pay—could be paid in confiscated Irish lands rather than in cash raised through English parliamentary taxes.<ref name=THOC>[http://www.irish-society.org/Hedgemaster%20Archives/Cromwell_2.htm "To Hell or to Connaught" Oliver Cromwell's Settlement of Ireland]</ref>

During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (1651–1660), this policy was enhanced with the passing of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement of Ireland]] in 1652 whose goal was a further transfer of land from Irish to English hands.<ref name=THOC/> The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native Irish Catholic population to the western fringes of Ireland to make way for Protestant settlers. This policy has been summed up by a phrase attributed to Cromwell "To Hell or to Connaught" and has been described by historians as [[ethnic cleansing]], if not genocide.<ref name=near-genocidal>genocidal or near-genocidal:
*Breton, Albert (ed). 1995. ''Nationalism and Rationality'', Cambridge University Press, Chapter "Regulating nations and ethnic communities" by Brendam O'Leary and John McGarry p 248. "Oliver Cromwell offered the Irish Catholics a choice between genocide and forced mass population transfer. They could go 'To Hell or to Connaught!'"
*Coogan, Tim-Pat. 2002. ''The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal and the Search for Peace''. ISBN 978-0312294182. Page 6. "The massacres by Catholics of Protestants, which occurred in the religious wars of the 1640s, were magnified for propagandist purposes to justify Cromwell's subsequent genocide."
*Ellis, Peter Berresford. 2002. ''Eyewitness to Irish History''. John Wiley & Sons Inc. Page 108. ISBN 978-0471266334. "It was to be the justification for Cromwell's genocidal campaign and settlement."
*Levene Mark. 2005. ''Genocide in the Age of the Nation-State'', I.B. Tauris: London: "Considered overall, an Irish population collapse from 1.5 or possibly over 2 million inhabitants at the onset of the Irish wars in 1641, to no more than 850,000 eleven years later represents an absolutely devastating demographic catastrophe. Undoubted the largest proportion of this massive death toll did not arise from direct massacre but from hunger and then [[bubonic plague]]s, especially from the outbreak between 1649 and 1652. Even so, the relationship to the worst years of the fighting is all too apparent.<br />[The Act of Settlement of Ireland], and the parliamentary legislation which succeeded it the following year, is the nearest thing on paper in the English, and more broadly British, domestic record, to a programme of state-sanctioned and systematic ethnic cleansing of another people. The fact that it did not include 'total' genocide in its remit, or that it failed to put into practice the vast majority of its proposed expulsions, ultimately, however, says less about the lethal determination of its makers and more about the political, structural and financial weakness of the early modern English state. For instance, though the Act begins rather ominously by claiming that it was not its intention to extirpate the whole Irish nation, it then goes on to list five categories of people who, as participators in or alleged supporters of the 1641 rebellion and its aftermath, would automatically be forfeit of their lives. It has been suggested that as many as 100,000 people would have been liable under these headings. A further five categories—by implication an even larger body of 'passive' supporters of the rebellion—were to be spared their lives but not their property."

[[Francis A.

Contesting claims of genocide, [[Belfast]]-born and [[Cambridge]]-educated historian Peter Gray concludes that UK government policy "was not a policy of deliberate genocide", but a dogmatic refusal to admit that the policy was wrong, which "amounted to a sentence of death to many thousands". Professor James S. Donnelly Jr., a historian at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], wrote that "...it is also my contention that while genocide was not in fact committed, what happened during and as a result of the clearances had the look of genocide to a great many Irish..."<ref>[http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/Irish/unit_6.html Irish Famine Unit VI Genocide] of the [http://www.nde.state.ne.us/SS/Irish/irish_pf.html The Great Irish Famine] Approved by the New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education on September 10, 1996</ref>

Records show that Ireland exported food during the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782–83, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests. No such  export ban happened in the 1840s.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Kinealy | first= Christine|year=1995|page=354|title=This Great Calamity: The Irish Famine 1845-52|isbn=1-57098-034-9|publisher= Gill & Macmillan}}</ref>

Cecil Woodham-Smith, an authority on the Irish Famine, wrote in ''The Great Hunger; Ireland 1845-1849'' that, "...no issue has provoked so much anger or so embittered relations [[Anglo-Irish Relations|between the two countries]] as the indisputable fact that huge quantities of food were exported from Ireland to England throughout the period when the people of Ireland were dying of starvation."<ref name="Woodham-Smith1991">{{Cite book

It has been frequently declared that the parsimony of the British government during the famine was the main cause of the sufferings of the people, and parsimony was certainly carried to remarkable lengths; but obtuseness, short-sightedness and ignorance probably contributed more."<ref name="Woodham-Smith1991">{{Cite book

Irish historian Cormac O' Grada disagrees with the claim that the famine was genocide on two grounds: firstly, he writes, "genocide includes murderous intent and it must be said that not even the most bigoted and racist commentators of the day sought the extermination of the Irish" .<ref name="Cormac O p. 10">Cormac O' Grada, "Black '47 and Beyond: The Great Irish Famine in History, Economy and Memory", p. 10</ref> and that most people in Whitehall "hoped for better times in Ireland.<ref name="Cormac O p. 10"/> and secondly accusations of genocide overlook or ignore "the enormous challenges facing relief efforts, both central, local, public and private".<ref name="Cormac O p. 10"/> Cormac views that a case of neglect is easier to sustain than that of genocide.<ref name="Cormac O p. 10"/> He also says that "no academic historian takes seriously any more the claim of 'genocide'", which were only supported by "a few nationalist historians".<ref name="grada cambridge">{{citation |title= The great Irish famine  |issue= 7 |series= New studies in economic and social history |author= Cormac Ó Gráda, Economic History Society |edition= illustrated, reprinted |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1995 |isbn= 9780521557870 |pages= 4, 68 |quote= [page 4] While no academic historian takes seriously any more the claim of 'genocide', the issue of blame remains controversial.

Ireland's experience during these years supports neither the complacency exemplified by the Whig view of political economy nor the genocide theories formerly espoused by a few nationalist historians. |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=X0uf6t8VfAsC }}</ref>

Peaking around 8-9 million in the early 19th century, Ireland's population fell to around 4 million during the Famine, because of emigration and starvation.<ref>Irish Famine Memorial Website - [http://irishfaminememorial.org/events/2002_shirley_fitzgerald.htm 2002 Shirley Fitzgerald Oration]</ref> <!--Modern historians and statisticians estimate that between 500,000 and 2,000,000 died.-->

Genocide scholar W.D. Rubinstein seems to agree with Cormac. In his book ''Genocide'' he wrote that: "The Irish Famine cannot in truth be described as an example of genocide, but nor, in truth, was it nineteenth-century Britain's finest hour."<ref name="Rubinstein2004">{{Cite book

====Russian Empire====
{{Main|Muhajir (Caucasus)|Caucasian War}}

The Russian Tsarist Empire waged war against [[Circassia]] in the Northwest Caucasus for nearly a hundred years, trying to get Circassia's prominent position along the [[Black Sea]] coast. After a century of insurgency and all-out war and continual failure to end the affair, the Tsar ordered the expulsion of most of the Muslim population of the North Caucasus. This event is remembered among Circassians as a national tragedy and is well-known among other Caucasian peoples and in Turkey as well. In the modern context of the word, there have been many claims, by Circassians, by Western historians (Colarusso, Charles King, etc.), by Turks and by Chechens that the events of the 1860s constituted one of the first "modern" horrible genocides in modern history, where a whole population is eliminated to satisfy the desires (in this case economic) of a powerful country.

Among many historians (including also John Colarusso, Charles King, etc.), Antero Leitzinger wrote in an article called "The Circassian Genocide", initially published in the [[Turkistan News]], that a genocide committed against the [[Circassians|Circassian]] nation by Czarist Russia in the 19th century has been almost entirely forgotten, and that it was the largest genocide of the 19th century.<ref>Antero Leitzinger "[http://www.circassianworld.com/circassiangenocide.html The Circassian Genocide]" in ''[[The Eurasian Politician]]'' - Issue 2, October 2000, in the article it states that it was originally published in [[Turkistan News]]</ref> Approximately 1-1.5 million Circassians were killed, and upon the order of the Tsar, most of the Muslim population was deported (i.e., all except Ossete Muslims and Kabardins; the modern Circassians and Abazins either managed to escape or, as is the case with most, returned; at the time after the deportation, as Charles King notes in his books, travelers who searched throughout the area for Circassians could not find any left except the Kabardins), mainly to the Ottoman Empire, causing the exile of another 1.5 million Circassians and others. This effectively annihilated (or deported) 90% of the nation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS104971+22-May-2009+PRN20090522|title=145th Anniversary of the Circassian Genocide and the Sochi Olympics Issue|date=22 May 2009|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=28 November 2009}}</ref> Circassians were viewed as tools by the Ottoman government, and settled in restive areas whose populations had nationalist yearnings- Armenia, the Arab regions and the Balkans. Many more Circassians were killed by the policies of the Balkan states, primarily Serbia and Bulgaria, which became independent at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Still more Circassians were forcefully assimilated by nationalist Muslim states (Turkey, Syria, Iraq, etc.) who looked upon non-Turk/Arab ethnicity as a foreign presence and a threat.

In May 1994, the then [[Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] admitted that [[Resistance movement|resistance]] to the [[tsarist]] forces was legitimate, but he did not recognize "the guilt of the tsarist government for the genocide."<ref name="Goble 2005">Goble 2005</ref> In 1997 and 1998, the leaders of [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] and of [[Republic of Adygea|Adygea]] sent appeals to the [[Duma]] to reconsider the situation and to issue the needed apology; to date, there has been no response from Moscow. In October 2006, the Adygeyan public organizations of Russia, Turkey, Israel, Jordan, Syria, the USA, Belgium, Canada and Germany sent the president of the [[European Parliament]] a letter with a request to recognize the genocide against Adygean (Circassian) people.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

On 5 July 2005 the [[Circassian Congress]], an organisation that unites representatives of the various Circassian peoples in the Russian Federation, called on Moscow first to acknowledge and then to apologize for Tsarist policies that Circassians say constituted a genocide. Their appeal pointed out that "according to the official tsarist documents more than 400,000 Circassians were killed, 497,000 were forced to flee abroad to Turkey, and only 80,000 were left alive in their native area."<ref name="Goble 2005"/> The movement has since been campaigning for the recognition of the "Circassian genocide".<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://circassiangenocide.org/ Circassian Genocide]. The Circassian Congress. 2008</ref> Nevertheless, whether it is considered genocide or not, just as is the case with the Armenians and Jews, the Circassians view the memory of the brutal expulsions and killings at the hands of Russia and the suffering that the Russians inflicted upon them as a central part of the Circassian identity.

On 15 September 2005, a United States Congressional resolution on the [[Armenian Genocide]], which did not pass, called upon the President to "ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the United States record relating to the Armenian Genocide, and for other purposes."

On 16 December 2003, the BBC reported that, "The Swiss lower house of parliament has voted to describe the mass killings of Armenians during the last years of the Ottoman Empire as genocide. [...] Fifteen countries have now agreed to label the killings as genocide. They include France [in 2001], Argentina and Russia."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3325247.stm Swiss accept Armenia 'genocide'], BBC 16 December 2003</ref> On 12 October 2006, French lawmakers "approved a bill making it a crime to deny that mass killings of Armenians in Turkey during and after World War I amounted to genocide. Turkey quickly objected, with its Foreign Ministry saying that the decision "dealt a heavy blow" to Turkish-French relations and 'created great disappointment in our country.'"<ref>[[Associated Press]] report "[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/10/12/Europe/EU_GEN_France_Turkey_Genocide_Bill.php French lawmakers approve bill on Armenian genocide]" in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' October 12, 2006</ref>

The Armenian and their distribution throughout Anatolia during the Ottoman Empire and before (largely a result of Persian scorched earth tactics in a 16th century war in the area) should be considered. The resources published in those years are telling various numbers. Very few of them actually state that there were over 2,000,000 Armenians back then, which is contrary to genocide allegations.<ref>Ottoman Armenian population, [[Ottoman Armenian population#Number of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire by different sources]], 2010</ref> However, that was only the maximum estimate, and even a considerably lower number would still classify as genocide due to motives, large amounts killed, and so on.

In 2005, Turkey made a proposal to form a joint historian committee between Turkish, Armenian and historians of various nationalities, who would aim to shed light on the issue of whether this was a genocide or not. Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan was quoted to say that "Turkey would be willing to face whatever the result the research produces".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=====Post-World War II deportations of North Caucasian peoples=====
The [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Stalinist deportations]] are also extremely controversial. During and after World War II, many minority ethnic groups, especially those from the North Caucasus, were exiled to Siberia, usually involving massacres as well{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. In many cases the targeted group was accused of collaborating with the Nazis. In some cases this was correct, as was the case with the [[Kalmyks]], but with others, such as the deportation of the [[Chechens]], it is usually discredited.

According to some authors, such as John B. Dunlop<ref>Dunlop, John B. ''Russia confronts Chechnya:Roots of a Separatist Conflict''. Page 40, and throughout chapter</ref> or Tony Wood <ref>Wood, Tony. '' Chechnya: The Case for Independence''. Pages 32-39</ref> ''Chechevitsa'' (or "[[Operation Lentil (Caucasus)|Operation Lentil]]" in Russian, according to Tony Wood, its first two syllables "point a finger at its intended targets", though while the Chechens were the main targets, they were not the only victims) is particularly troubling. The operation is referred to by Chechens often as "Aardakh" (the Exodus). It was initiated on October 13, 1943 when about 120,000 men were moved into the [[Republic of Checheno-Ingushetia]], supposedly for mending bridges. On February 23, 1944 (on Red Army day), the entire population was summoned to local party buildings where they were told they were going to be deported as punishment for their alleged collaboration with the Germans. The inhabitants were rounded up and imprisoned in Studebaker trucks and sent to Siberia.<ref>Dunlop,''Russia confronts Chechnya'', p65</ref><ref>Gammer, ''The Lone Wolf and the Bear'', p170</ref> Many times, resistance was met with slaughter, and in one such instance, in the aul of Khaibakh, about 700 people were locked in a barn and burned to death by NKVD general Gveshiani, who was praised for this and promised a medal by [[Lavrentiy Beria]]. By the next summer, Checheno-Ingushetia was dissolved; a number of Chechen and Ingush placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques and graveyards were destroyed, and a massive campaign to burn numerous historical Chechen texts was nearly complete (leaving the world depleted of what was more or less the only source of central Caucasian literature and historical texts except for sparse texts about the Chechens, Ingush, etc., not written by themselves, but by Georgians) <ref>Gammer, ''The Lone Wolf and the Bear'', p182</ref><ref>Jaimoukha.

Many died on the trip, and the extremely harsh environment of Siberia (especially considering the amount of exposure) killed many more. The NKVD, supplying the Russian perspective, gives the statistic of 144,704 people killed in 1944-1948 alone (with a death rate of 23.5% for all groups), though this is dismissed by many authors such as Tony Wood as a far understatement .<ref>Wood, Tony.

=====The Mass Deportations in the Baltic States of Lithuanians, Latvians and Estonians=====
The ground for [[Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union|mass deportations]]  differed in [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]. The mass deportation resulted directly from the [[Occupation_and_annexation_of_the_Baltic_states_by_the_Soviet_Union_(1940)|Soviet occupation of the sovereign Baltic States]] during the World War II in accordance to the secret protocols of [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] under which [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]] and [[Winter War|Finland]] fell in the sphere of influence of [[the Soviet Union]]. The second wave of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|mass deportations]] came after the World War II neared its end, Nazis retreated and [[Occupation_and_annexation_of_the_Baltic_states_by_the_Soviet_Union_(1944)|Soviet Union reoccupied the three Baltic States]]. The mass deportation was used as a policy to combat the resistance movements, such as the [[Lithuanian partisans]], and those who allegedly supported them by any means. The mass deportation to [[Siberia]] was also used to fully incorporate the people of [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] into the ideological economic and everyday-life practices of the [[Soviet Union]]: mass collectivisation, the complete abolishment of private property and atheism. For these ultimate goals, it was not all the people in the [[Baltic States]] which were targeted and affected the mass deportation in its own right, but very specific groups: all the [[Lithuanian partisans]], those who allegedly supported them, all the former military men, rich peasants, middle-class peasants who were involuntary to join the national [[collectivization]], business owners and those entrepreneurs who refused to join the [[nationalization]], most renowned and influential priests, professors, intellectuals and anyone who opposed or had an intellectual and physical potential to oppose the [[Soviet]] regime. More than 200,000 people are estimated to have been deported from [[the Baltics]] in 1940-1953. In addition, at least 75,000 were sent to [[Gulag]]. 10% of the entire adult Baltic population was deported or sent to labor camps.<ref>[http://www.ahtg.net/TpA/baltstat.html The Baltic States]</ref><ref>[http://www.rel.ee/eng/communism_crimes.htm Communism and Crimes against Humanity in the Baltic states]</ref> (See [[June deportation]], [[Operation Priboi]], [[Soviet deportations from Estonia]].) The extremely wide scope of social groups and those affected by the [[Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union|mass deportations in Baltics]] is extremely controversial in the context a [[genocide]]. In essence, only those who showed loyalty to the occupying force of the [[Soviet]] regime could certainly not be affected by the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|mass deportations]] and this is highly contradictory to the perception of national-identity and the universal human rights for self-determination.

Estonia attempted to charge Soviet-era officials with genocide on the grounds that the exiles to Siberia constituted genocide.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6959632.stm | work=BBC News | title=Estonian man on genocide charge | date=23 August 2007 | accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref><ref>http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-03-28/Estonian_Red_Army_veteran_dies_amidst_genocide_trial.html</ref>  A memorial at Vilna in Lithuania is dedicated to the genocide victims of Stalin as well as Hitler,<ref>http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/odlin1/Graphics/lith/lithgen.htm</ref> and the Museum of Genocide Victims in Lithuania dedicated for Stalin's imprisonment and deportation of [[Lithuanians]].<ref>http://www.genocid.lt/muziejus/en/380/a/</ref>

Because of the universal acceptance of [[international law]]s, defining and forbidding genocide was achieved in 1948, with the promulgation of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG), those criminals who were prosecuted after the war in international courts, for taking part in the Holocaust were found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]] and other more specific crimes like murder. Nevertheless the Holocaust is universally recognized to have been a genocide and the term, that had been coined the year before by [[Raphael Lemkin]],<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: 1944 R.

The Holocaust was accomplished in stages. [[Nuremberg Laws|Legislation to remove the Jews from civil society]] was enacted years before the outbreak of World War II. [[Nazi concentration camps|Concentration camps]] were established in which inmates were used as slave labour until they died of exhaustion or disease. Where the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] conquered new territory in eastern Europe, specialized units called [[Einsatzgruppen]] murdered Jews and political opponents in mass shootings.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6724481.stm Ukrainian mass Jewish grave found]</ref> Jews and Romani were crammed into [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939&ndash;1944|ghettos]] before being transported hundreds of miles by freight train to [[extermination camp]]s where, if they survived the journey, the majority of them were killed in gas chambers. Every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the mass murder, turning the country into what one Holocaust scholar has called "a genocidal nation."<ref name=Berenbaum103>Berenbaum, Michael. ''The World Must Know", United States Holocaust Museum'', 2006, p. 103.</ref>

Other targets of the Nazi mass murder or "Nazi genocidal policy",<ref>[http://fcit.usf.edu/Holocaust/people/victims.htm A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust-Victims]</ref> included Slavs ([[Poles]], [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Belarusians]], [[Serbs]], and others), [[Romani people]] (see [[Porajmos]]), [[mentally ill]] (see [[T-4 Euthanasia Program]]), [[Homosexuals]] and "sexual deviants", [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and political opponents. [[R. J. Rummel]] estimates that 16,315,000 people died as a result of genocide, just over 10.5 million Slavs, just under 5.3 million Jews, 258,000 Romani and 220,000 homosexuals.<ref>R.J.

====Croatia====
After the [[Nazi]] invasion of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], Nazis and fascists established the puppet Croatian state known as ''Nezavisna Država Hrvatska'' ([[Independent State of Croatia]]) or NDH. Immediately after its establishment, the NDH began a terror campaign against [[Serb]]s, [[Jew]]s and [[Romani people]].

The Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia were part of an [[ethnic cleansing]] (recognized in Poland as ethnic cleansing with "marks of genocide."<ref>{{cite web|title=Uchwala Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 15 lipca 2009 r. w sprawie tragicznego losu Polakow na Kresach Wschodnich|url=http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WMP20090470684|publisher=Biuro Prasowe Kancelarii Sejmu|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref>) operation carried out by the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] (UPA) West in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] occupied regions of the [[Eastern Galicia]] (Nazi created [[District of Galicia|Distrikt Galizien]] in [[General Government]]), and UPA North in [[Volhynia]] (in Nazi created [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]), beginning in March 1943 and lasting until the end of 1944.

However, according to Katchanovski, the actions which occurred in Volhynia cannot be classified as genocide "because there is no evidence of an intent to eliminate entire or a significant party of the Polish population, and the anti-Polish action was mostly limited to a relatively small region."

====Dominican Republic====
In 1937, Dominican dictator [[Rafael Trujillo]] ordered the execution of Haitians living in the [[Dominican Republic]]. The [[Parsley Massacre]], known in the Dominican Republic as "El Corte" (the Cutting), lasted approximately five days. Trujillo had his soldiers apply parsley to suspected Haitians and they would ask, "What is this?" Spanish speaking people would be able to pronounce the Spanish word for parsley perfectly, "perejil". In Haitian Creole, the word for parsley is "persil". Those who would have trouble pronouncing "perejil" would be assumed to be Haitian and slaughtered. The violence resulted in the deaths of 20,000 to 30,000 people.<ref>[[Parsley Massacre]]</ref>

====Partition of India in 1947====
During the 1947 [[Partition of India]] millions of [[Muslim]]s, [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s were slaughtered based on being on the wrong side of the newly formed border. When the partition lines were drawn, many Muslims who found themselves on the Indian side of the border were targeted by Sikh and Hindu mobs. Similarly, many Sikhs and Hindus suffered at the hands of Muslim mobs in Pakistan. Estimates of the total number of dead vary from 500,000 to 1 million. In addition approximately 7 million Muslims migrated to Pakistan while approximately the same number of Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India. The violence was especially gruesome in the densely populated plains of [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. At the end of the Partition violence, very few Muslims remained in Indian Punjab, and very few Hindus and Sikhs remained in Pakistani Punjab. The situation was comparatively better in the other partitioned province of [[Bengal]].

====Republic of China and Tibet====

Universal acceptance of [[international law]]s, defining and forbidding genocide was achieved in 1948, with the promulgation of the ''Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide'' (CPPCG). The CPPCG was adopted by the [[UN General Assembly]] on 9 December 1948 and came into effect on 12 January 1951 (Resolution 260 (III)). After the minimum 20 countries became parties to the Convention, it came into force as international law on 12 January 1951. At that time however, only two of the five permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]] (UNSC) were parties to the treaty, which caused the Convention to languish for over four decades.

{{Main|Stolen Generation|History wars}}

Sir [[Ronald Wilson]], former president of Australia's Human Rights Commission thinks that Australia's "[[Stolen Generation]]" — where from 1900 to 1970, 20,000 to 25,000 Aboriginal children were forcibly separated from their natural families (see the [[Bringing Them Home]] report)<ref name=RM-The-Age>Manne, Robert [http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/the-cruelty-of-denial/2006/09/08/1157222325367.html "The cruelty of denial"], ''[[The Age]]'', September 9, 2006</ref> — "It clearly was attempted genocide ...

====Zanzibar====
In 1964, towards the end of the [[Zanzibar Revolution]]—which led to the overthrow of the [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] and his mainly Arab government by local African revolutionaries—[[John Okello]] claimed in radio speeches to have killed or imprisoned tens of thousands of his "enemies and stooges,"<ref name="parsons107">{{Cite book|last=Parsons|first=Timothy|title=The 1964 Army Mutinies and the Making of Modern East Africa|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|location=|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KoLbjlIYLzwC|isbn=0325070687|oclc= pages = p. 107|ref=harv|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> but actual estimates of the number of deaths vary greatly, from "hundreds" to 20,000.

{{Main|Guatemalan civil war}}

During the [[Guatemala]]n civil war, some 200,000 people died. More than one million people were forced to flee their homes and hundreds of villages were destroyed. The officially chartered [[Historical Clarification Commission]] attributed more than 93% of all documented violations of human rights to Guatemala's military government; and estimated that [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] accounted for 83% of the victims. It concluded in 1999 that state actions constituted genocide.<ref>[http://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/1999/19990301.guate.brf.html Press conference by members of the Guatemala Historical Clarification Commission], United Nations website, 1 March 1999</ref><ref>Staff.

====Pakistan (Bangladesh War of 1971)====
{{Main|1971 Bangladesh atrocities|Operation Searchlight|Bangladesh Liberation War}}
In 1997 [[R. J. Rummel]] published a book, [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NOTE5.HTM available on the web], called "Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900", In Chapter 8 called "Statistics Of Pakistan's Democide
Estimates, Calculations, And Sources" he looks at the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. Rummel wrote:

:In [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) [the [[President of Pakistan]], General [[Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan]], and his top generals] also planned to murder its Bengali intellectual, cultural, and political elite. They also planned to indiscriminately murder hundreds of thousands of its Hindus and drive the rest into India. And they planned to destroy its economic base to insure that it would be subordinate to West Pakistan for at least a generation to come. This plan may be perceived as genocide.<ref name="Rummel">Rummel, Rudolph J., [http://www.Hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP8.HTM "Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900"], ISBN 3-8258-4010-7, Chapter 8, table 8.1</ref>

Rummel goes on to collate what he considers the most credible estimates published by others into what he calls [[democide]]. He writes that "Consolidating both ranges, I give a final estimate of Pakistan's democide to be 300,000 to 3,000,000, or a prudent 1,500,000." Other authors like Anthony Mascarenhas and Donald W.

====Rwanda 1994====
{{Main|Rwandan genocide}}
The Rwandan Genocide was the 1994 mass killing of an estimated 800,000 people. Over the course of approximately 100 days from the assassination  of President [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] on April 6 through mid-July, at least 800,000 people were killed, according to a Human Rights Watch estimate.  In 1990, a rebel group composed mostly of [[Tutsi]] refugees called the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) invaded northern Rwanda from Uganda. The Rwandan Civil War, fought between the [[Hutu]] regime, with support from [[Francophone Africa|Francophone nations of Africa]] and France itself, and the RPF, with support from [[Uganda]], vastly increased the ethnic tensions in the country and led to the rise of [[Hutu Power]].
As an ideology, Hutu Power asserted that the Tutsi intended to enslave Hutus and must be resisted at all costs. Despite continuing ethnic strife, including the displacement of large numbers of Hutu in the north by the rebels and periodic localized extermination of Tutsi to the south, pressure on the government of Juvénal Habyarimana resulted in a cease-fire in 1993 and the preliminary implementation of the [[Arusha Accords]].
The assassination of Habyarimana in April 1994 was the proximate cause of the mass killings of Tutsis and pro-peace Hutus. The mass killings were carried out primarily by two Hutu militias associated with political parties: the [[Interahamwe]] and the [[Impuzamugambi]]. The genocide was directed by a Hutu power group known as the [[Akazu]]. The mass killing also marked the end of the peace agreement meant to end the war, and the Tutsi RPF restarted their offensive, eventually defeating the Hutu army and seizing control of the country.

====North Korea====

Several millions in [[North Korea]] have died of starvation since the mid-1990s, with aid groups and human rights NGOs stating often that North Korea has systematically and deliberately prevented food aid from reaching the areas most devastated by food shortages.<ref>[http://reliefweb.int/node/60818 Action Against Hunger Stops Its Activities in North Korea]</ref> Up to one million have died in North Korea's political prison camps which detain dissidents and their entire families, including children, for perceived political offences.<ref name="washingtonpost.com">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/when-will-we-stop-the-genocide-in-north-korea/2011/03/29/AFqXaMEE_story.html When will we stop the genocide in North Korea?]</ref> 

In 2004, [[Yad Vashem]], in response to the BBC documentary, "Access to Evil", which includes witness testimonies from camp survivors and a former guard of gas chambers and mass killings occurring systematically in the camps, called on the international community in 2004 to investigate “political genocide” in North Korea, yet no substantial action has been taken to this day to intervene.<ref name="washingtonpost.com"/> 

In September 2011, the Harvard International Review published an article which argued that North Korea was violating the UN Genocide Convention in every possible way, through its systematic killing of half-Chinese babies and religious groups.<ref>[http://hir.harvard.edu/north-korea-and-the-genocide-movement North Korea and the Genocide Movement]</ref>

====Equatorial Guinea====
[[Francisco Macías Nguema]] was the first [[President of Equatorial Guinea|President]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]], from 1968 until his overthrow in 1979.<ref>[http://www.dictatorofthemonth.com/Nguema/Dec2001NguemaEN.htm Francisco Macias Nguema]</ref> During his presidency, his country was nicknamed "the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] of Africa". Nguema's regime was characterized by its abandonment of all government functions except internal security, which was accomplished by terror; he acted as chief judge and sentenced thousands to death. This led to the death or exile of up to 1/3 of the country's population. Out of a population of 300,000, an estimated 80,000 had been killed, in particular those of the [[Bubi people|Bubi]] ethnic minority on [[Bioko]] associated with relative wealth and intellectualism.<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article2530772.ece Coup plotter faces life in Africa's most notorious jail]</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=455635&in_page_id=1770 True hell on earth: Simon Mann faces imprisonment in the cruellest jail on the planet]</ref> Uneasy around educated people, he had killed everyone who wore spectacles.

On August 3, 1979, he was overthrown by [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200111/19/eng20011119_84896.shtml |title=Chinese President Meets Equatorial Guinean President |date=2001-11-20 |work=People's Daily Online |location=Beijing, China}}</ref> Macías Nguema was captured, tried for genocide and other crimes along with 10 others. All of them were found guilty, four received terms of imprisonment, while Nguema and the other six were executed a few weeks later on September 29.<ref>John B. Quigley (2006) ''The Genocide Convention: An International Law Analysis'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, ISBN 0754647307.

John B. Quigley in ''The Genocide Convention: An International Law Analysis'' points out that at Macías Nguema's trial for genocide that Equatorial Guinea had not ratified the Genocide convention and that records of the court proceedings show that there was some confusion over whether Nguema and his co-defendants were tried under the laws of Spain (the former colonial power), or whether the trial was justified on the claim that the Genocide Convention was part of customary international law. Quigley states that "The Macias case stands out as the most confusing of domestic genocide prosecutions from the standpoint of the applicable law. The Macias conviction is also problematic from the standpoint of the identity of the protected group."<ref>John B. Quigley (2006) ''The Genocide Convention: An International Law Analysis'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, ISBN 0754647307.

The [[Khmer Rouge]], or more formally, the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]], led by [[Pol Pot]], [[Ta Mok]] and other leaders, organized the mass killing of ideologically suspect groups, ethnic minorities like the ethnic Vietnamese, Chinese (or Sino-Khmers), [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]]s and [[Thai People|Thais]], former civil servants, former government soldiers, [[Buddhist monk]]s, secular intellectuals and professionals, and former city dwellers. Khmer Rouge cadres defeated in factional struggles were also liquidated in [[purges]]. The total number of victims is estimated at approximately 1.7 million [[Cambodia]]ns between 1975–1979, including deaths from slave labour.<ref name=Yale-CGP>[http://www.yale.edu/cgp/index.html Cambodian Genocide Program], [[Yale University]]'s MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies</ref>

Ysa Osman, a researcher at the Documentation Center of Cambodia concludes,"Perhaps as many as 500,000 died. They were considered the Khmer Rouge's No. 1 enemy. The plan was to exterminate them all" because "they stood out. They worshiped their own god. Their diet was different. Their names and language were different. They lived by different rules. The Khmer Rouge wanted everyone to be equal, and when the Chams practiced Islam they did not appear to be equal.

====East Timor under Indonesian occupation====
{{Main|Indonesian occupation of East Timor}}
[[East Timor]] was occupied by [[Indonesia]] from 1975 to 1999 as an annexed territory with Indonesian provincial status. A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974-1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 excess deaths from hunger and illness, including the Indonesian military using "starvation as a weapon to exterminate the East Timorese"<ref>[http://www.yale.edu/gsp/east_timor/unverdict.html UN verdict on East Timor]</ref> most of which occurred during the Indonesian occupation.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974-1999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml}}</ref> Earlier estimates of deaths during the occupation range from 60,000 to 200,000.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Nunes |first=Joe |title=East Timor: Acceptable Slaughters |work=The architecture of modern political power |year=1996 |url=http://www.mega.nu/ampp/nunestimor.html}}</ref>

According to Sian Powell writing in ''[[The Australian]]'', a UN report states that the Indonesian military used starvation as a weapon to exterminate the East Timorese, along with [[Napalm]] and [[chemical warfare|chemical weapons]], obtained from the United States, which poisoned the food and water supply.<ref>Sian Powell ''[http://www.yale.edu/gsp/east_timor/unverdict.html UN verdict on East Timor], Jakarta correspondent, [[The Australian]], January 19, 2006</ref> Ben Kiernan has written in ''War, Genocide, and Resistance in East Timor, 1975–99: Comparative Reflections on Cambodia'' that

<blockquote><p>the crimes committed ... in East Timor, with a toll of 150,000 in a population of 650,000, clearly meet a range of sociological definitions of genocide used by most scholars of the phenomenon, who see both political and ethnic groups as possible victims of genocide. The victims in East Timor included not only that substantial 'part' of the Timorese 'national group' targeted for destruction because of their resistance to Indonesian annexation—along with their relatives, as we shall see—but also most members of the twenty-thousand strong ethnic Chinese minority prominent in the towns of East Timor, whom Indonesian forces singled out for destruction, apparently because of their ethnicity 'as such.'<ref name="Kiernam">Ben Kiernam {{PDFlink|[http://www.yale.edu/gsp/east_timor/03-263_Ch_09.pdf War, Genocide, and Resistance in East Timor, 1975–99: Comparative Reflections on Cambodia]|218&nbsp;KB}}, Chapter 9 page 202</ref><ref>Ben Kiernan's footnotes "clearly meet a range of sociological definitions of genocide..." with [13] – Leo Kuper, ''Genocide'' (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1981), pages 174-175</ref></p></blockquote>

Ben Kiernan draws a comparison with the Khmer Rouge Cambodian genocide, and accuses the west of hypocrisy in ignoring one whilst protesting about the other.

====Dirty War in Argentina====
[[File:Acto recuperación de La Perla (Córdoba)-24MAR07-Autor Martín Gaitán(4).jpg|right|thumb|250px|Commemoration in Argentina]]
In September 2006, [[Miguel Osvaldo Etchecolatz]], who had been the police commissioner of the province of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] during the [[Dirty War]] (1976–1983), was found guilty of six counts of murder, six counts of unlawful imprisonment, and seven counts of torture in a federal court. The judge who presided over the case, Carlos Rozanski, described the offences as part of a systematic attack that was intended to destroy parts of society that the victims represented and as such it was genocide.<ref name=Klein-100-102>
Naomi Klein. ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', Macmillan, 2007 ISBN 9780805079838.

Rozanski noted that the CPPCG does not include the elimination of political groups, (because that group was removed at the behest of Stalin), but instead based his findings on 11 December 1946 [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 96]] barring acts of  genocide "when racial, religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or in part" (which passed unanimously), because he considered the original UN definition to be more legitimate than the politically compromised  CPPCG definition.<ref name=Klein-100-102/>

====Sabra-Shatila, Lebanon====
{{Main|Sabra and Shatila massacre}}

The Sabra and Shatila massacre was carried out in September 1982 against Palestinians in the [[Sabra and Shatila]] refugee camps by Lebanese [[Lebanese Forces|Maronite Christian]]/[[Kataeb Party|Phalange]] militias, near the beginning of the [[1982–2000 South Lebanon conflict]]. The [[Sabra and Shatila massacre#Number of victims|number of victims of the massacre]] is estimated at 700-3500. Responsibility for the massacre has been attributed to the Phalangists as the perpetrators, and indirectly to [[Israel]] as the ally of the Phalangists.<ref name=GA-34,37>Georges Andreopoulos, ''Genocide. Conceptual and Historical Dimensions'', p.24, 37</ref>

On December 16, 1982, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] condemned the massacre and declared it to be an act of genocide.<ref>[http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r123.htm A/RES/37/123(A-F)]  [http://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/res/resa37.htm Adopted at the 108th UN General Assembly plenary meeting] 16 December 1982 and the 112th plenary meeting, 20 December 1982.</ref> Paragraph 2, which "resolved that the massacre was an act of genocide", was adopted by ninety-eight votes to nineteen, with twenty-three abstentions: All Western democracies abstained from voting.<ref name=LK-37>Leo Kuper, "Theoretical Issues Relating to Genocide: Uses and Abuses", in George J. Andreopoulos, ''Genocide: Conceptual and Historical Dimensions'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997, ISBN 0812216164, p. 37.</ref><ref name=WS-455>William Schabas, ''Genocide in International Law. The Crimes of Crimes'', p. 455</ref>

According to William Schabas, director of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the [[National University of Ireland]],<ref>[http://www.nuigalway.ie/human_rights/Staff/william_schabas.html Professor William A. Schabas] website of the Irish Centre for Human Rights at the [[National University of Ireland]]</ref> "the term genocide (...) had obviously been chosen to embarrass Israel rather than out of any concern with legal precision".<ref name=WS-455/> This opinion is a reflection of the comments made by some of the delegates who took part in the debate. While all acknowledged that it was a massacre, the claim that it was a genocide was disputed, for example the delegate for Canada stated "[t]he term genocide cannot, in our view, be applied to this particular inhuman act".<ref name=WS-455/> The delegate of [[Singapore]] added that "[his] delegation regret[ted] the use of the term "an act of genocide" (...) [as] the term 'genocide' is used to mean acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group".<ref name=WS-455/> and that "[he] also question[ned] whether the General Assembly ha[d] the competence to make such determination",<ref name=WS-455/> and the United States commented that "[w]hile the criminality of the massacre was beyond question, it was a serious and reckless misuse of language to label this tragedy genocide as defined in the 1948 Convention (...)".<ref name=WS-455/>

Citing Sabra and Shatila as an example, Leo Kuper notes the reluctance of the United Nations to respond or take action in actual cases of genocide against the most egregious violators, but its willingness to charge "certain vilified states, and notably Israel", with genocide. In his view:
<blockquote>This availability of a scapegoat state in the UN restores members with a record of murderous violence against their subjects a self-righteous sense of moral purpose as principled members of 'the community of nations'... Estimates of the numbers killed in the Sabra-Shatila massacres range from about four hundred to eight hundred - a minor catastrophe in the contemporary statistics of mass murder. Yet a carefully planned UN campaign found Israel guilty of genocide, without reference to the role of the Phalangists in perpetrating the massacres on their own initiative. The procedures were unique in the annals of the United Nations.<ref name=LK-36-37>Leo Kuper, "Theoretical Issues Relating to Genocide: Uses and Abuses", in George J. Andreopoulos, ''Genocide: Conceptual and Historical Dimensions'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1997, ISBN 0812216164, pp. 36-37.</ref></blockquote>

In a [[War Crimes Law (Belgium)|Belgium court case]] lodged on 18 June 2001 by 23 survivors of the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacres, the prosecution alleged that [[Ariel Sharon]], former Israeli defense minister (and Israel's Prime Minister in 2001&ndash;2006), as well as other Israelis committed a number of crimes including genocide,<ref name=case>[http://www.indictsharon.net/case.shtml#Introduction The Case Against The Accused] (Ariel Sharon, former Israeli defense minister and Israel's prime minister in 2001, as well as other Israelis and Lebanese), [http://www.indictsharon.net/ indictsharon.net] &ndash; The website of the International Campaign for Justice for the Victims of Sabra & Shatila</ref> because "all the constituent elements of the crime of genocide, as defined in the 1948 Convention and as reproduced in article 6 of the ICC Statute and in article 1§1 of the law of 16 June 1993, 29 are present".<ref name=cmptENen>[http://www.indictsharon.net/cmptENen.pdf The complaint against Ariel Sharon] Lodged in Belgium on 18 June 2001</ref> This allegation was not tested in a Belgian court because on 12 February 2003 the Court of Cassation (Belgian Supreme Court) ruled that under international customary law, acting heads of state and government can not become the objects of proceedings before criminal tribunals in foreign states (although for the crime of genocide they could be the subjects of proceedings of an international tribunal).<ref name=cmptENen>[http://www.indictsharon.net/12feb2003dectrans.pdf English translation of Belgian Supreme Court Decision (unauthorised)], 12 February 2003</ref><ref>Chibli Mallat, Michael Verhaeghe, Luc Walleyn and Laurie King-Irani [http://www.indictsharon.net/case-diary15.shtml The February 2003 Decision of the Belgian Supreme Court Explained] on the website of [http://www.indictsharon.net/ indictsharon.net], 19 February 2003</ref> This ruling was a reiteration of [[Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v.

====Soviet intervention in Afghanistan====
M. Hassan Kakar presents an argument in a chapter called "Genocide Throughout the Country"<ref name=HassanKakar-13-GTC/> in his book ''The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response, 1979-1982''<ref name=HassanKakar-Index/>  that the international definition of genocide is too restricted, and that it should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator as described by Chalk and Jonassohn: "Genocide is a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group, as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator."<ref name=FCKJ/>

Having established a broader definition of Genocide Kakar goes on to claim that during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] (1979&ndash;1989), "The Afghans are among the latest victims of genocide by a superpower. Large numbers of Afghans were killed to suppress resistance to the army of the Soviet Union, which wished to vindicate its client regime and realize its goal in Afghanistan. Thus, the mass killing was political".<ref>{{cite book | last = Kakar, M.

====Tibet====
On 5 June 1959 Shri Purshottam Trikamdas, Senior Advocate, [[Supreme Court of India]], presented a report on Tibet to the [[International Commission of Jurists]] (an [[non-governmental organisation|NGO]]). The press conference address on the report states in paragraph 26 that

{{cquote|From the facts stated above the following conclusions may be drawn: ... (e) To examine all such evidence obtained by this Committee and from other sources and to take appropriate action thereon and in particular to determine whether the crime of Genocide – for which already there is strong presumption – is established and, in that case, to initiate such action as envisaged by the Genocide Convention of 1948 and by the Charter of the United Nations for suppression of these acts and appropriate redress;<ref>[http://www.icj.org/news.php3?id_article=3415&lang=en&print=true Tibet - Summary of a Report on Tibet] Submitted to the [[International Commission of Jurists]] by Shri Purshottam Trikamdas, Senior Advocate, Supreme Court of India</ref>}}

The report of the International Commission of Jurists (1960) is widely misquoted as stating that there was physical genocide (mass killings). It actually claims that there was only cultural genocide.

ICJ Report (1960) page 346: "The committee found that acts of genocide had been committed in Tibet in an attempt to destroy the Tibetans as a religious group, and that such acts are acts of genocide independently of any conventional obligation. The committee did not find that there was sufficient proof of the destruction of Tibetans as a race, nation or ethnic group as such by methods that can be regarded as genocide in international law".

However cultural genocide is also contested by some academics such as Barry Sautman.<ref name="Sautman">{{cite journal|last=Sautman|first=Barry|date=October 2006|title=Colonialism, genocide, and Tibet|journal=Asian Ethnicity|volume=7|issue=3|pages=243–265|doi=10.1080/14631360600926949}}</ref> Tibetan is the everyday language of Tibetans in Tibet.

The [[Helmet Massacre]] of the [[Tikuna people]] took place in 1988, and was initially treated as homicide. During the massacre four people died, nineteen were wounded, and ten disappeared. Since 1994 it has been treated by Brazilian courts as a genocide. Thirteen men were convicted of genocide in 2001. In November 2004, after an appeal was filed before Brazil's federal court, the man initially found guilty of hiring men to carry out the genocide was acquitted, and the other men had their initial sentences of 15–25 years reduced to 12 years.<ref>Staff.

In November 2005 during an investigation by the Brazilian authorities, code-named [[Operation Rio Pardo]], Mario Lucio Avelar, a Brazilian public prosecutor in the city of [[Cuiabá]], told [[Survival International]] that he believed that there were sufficient grounds to prosecute for genocide of the [[Rio Pardo]] Indians.

==International prosecution of genocide==
===Ad hoc tribunals===
In 1951 only two of the five permanent members of the [[UN Security Council]] (UNSC) were parties to the CPPCG: France and the Republic of China. The CPPCG was ratified by the Soviet Union in 1954, the United Kingdom in 1970, the People's Republic of China in 1983 (having replaced the Taiwan-based Republic of China on the UNSC in 1971), and the United States in 1988. So it was only in the 1990s that the international law on the crime of genocide began to be enforced.

[[Image:Rwanda genocide wanted poster 2-20-03.jpg|thumb||Wanted poster for the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]]]]

The [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) is a court under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] for the prosecution of offenses committed in [[Rwanda]] during the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide that occurred there]] during April and May, 1994, commencing on April 6. The ICTR was created on November 8, 1994 by the Security Council of the United Nations to judge those people responsible for the acts of genocide and other serious violations of the international law performed in the territory of Rwanda, or by Rwandan citizens in nearby states, between January 1 and December 31, 1994.

As of mid-2011, the ICTR has convicted 57 accused persons (including 19 whose cases are on appeal) and acquitted eight. Another ten persons are still on trial while [[Bernard Munyagishari|one]] is awaiting trial.  Nine remain at large.<ref>http://www.unictr.org/Cases/StatusofCases/tabid/204/Default.aspx</ref>  The first trial, of [[Jean Akayesu|Jean-Paul Akayesu]], ended in 1998 with his conviction for genocide and crimes against humanity.<ref>http://www.unictr.org/Cases/tabid/127/PID/18/default.aspx?id=4&mnid=4</ref> This was notable as the world's first conviction for the crime of genocide, as defined by the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]]. [[Jean Kambanda]], interim Prime Minister during the genocide, pled guilty.
