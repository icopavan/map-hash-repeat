== [[User:Magonaritus|Magonaritus]] and sockpuppetry ==

The person who registered the {{User|Magonaritus}} account has been causing disruptions, on and off, at [[Upper Canada College]] and the relevant [[Talk:Upper Canada College|talk page]] for over a year. He/she has used a series of both IP and registered sockpuppets to influence the outcome of discussions on article content and format at talk, generally in an abrasive, uncooperative manner; all-together violating [[WP:NPOV]], [[WP:NOR]], [[WP:AGF]], [[WP:CIV]], [[WP:NPA]], [[WP:NLT]], [[WP:NOT#SOAP]], [[WP:VAND]], [[WP:POINT]], and, of course, [[WP:SOCK]], leading to edit wars and the page being locked. Evidence strongly points to sockpuppetry; such evidence and connections have been outlined [[User:G2bambino/temp|here]]. A [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Magonaritus|request for checkuser]] was already deemed unnecessary. Could an admin please look at this case and decide whether the relevant accounts should be blocked? --[[User:G2bambino|G2bambino]] 00:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

== [[User:Ivan Kricancic|Ivan Kricanci]] ==

Ivan's second account [[User:Rts_freak|Rts_freak]] was blocked indefinitely and he was strongly warned by [[User:AnonEMouse|AnonEMouse]]. You can see that here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic Ivan Kricancic - sock puppet]. Ivan had second account which he created in order to nominate Bosniak-related pictures for deletion providing false information about the authors. He is an ethnic Croat, so he created the second account presenting himself to be an ethnic Bosniak who doesn't speak Bosnian, because he is from Australia. According to his user page (original user page) he hates Bosniaks, and makes funny of them. So his "ethnic Bosniak" account was blocked and he was warned. I noticed similar behaviour on Bosniak-related topics:

* {{checkip|58.165.126.167}} 
* {{checkip|58.165.115.192}}

Here is another earlier case that proves this, just compare his address [http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17 58.165.126.17] and his edit 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17 58.165.126.17] in his original user page.  

Here are some examples about his Bosniak-image obsession, when he was logged in:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&diff=prev&oldid=83627378]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&diff=prev&oldid=95269086]

(It should be noted that he first nominated those pictures for deletion)

And here is an example how he put false information when he was not logged in, about the Bosniak-related picture in order to nominate it for deletion:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&diff=prev&oldid=107251063]

And here is an example when he promoted his ideas using his second blocked account, [[User:Rts_freak|Rts_freak]]:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&diff=82810189&oldid=40603570]

The worst thing is that he wrote lies about other users who donated pictures to Wikipedia. He said:

''This image was unlikely to have been taken by [[User:Asim Led|Asim Led]]. He has a history of providing dubious sources, and lying about source info. Impropper licence. Since the image is probably unfree, it is also missing a fair use rationale.''

Now, I want to show you few edits, just about Bosniaks and Bosnian language, he really hates them, when he was not logged in:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&diff=prev&oldid=107244478]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosnian_language&diff=prev&oldid=107245061]
and when he was logged in:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&diff=prev&oldid=97674814].

There are so many examples, but the best thing is to look again the evidence here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic Ivan Kricancic - sock puppet] when Ivan was blocked earlier. [[User:Emir Arven|Emir Arven]] 00:19, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

== {{User|Emir Arven}} - Some help needed ==

Hello people. Can I please get someone to help me with [[User:Emir Arven|Emir Arven]]? Myself and this user have had disputes in the past, and both of us have been blocked as a result of personal attacks against each other. Our last dispute was a result of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina&diff=prev&oldid=107274183 this edit summary]. I then calmly started a discussion with the user about why they would falsely accuse me like that, but he just turned hostile straight away. The user then started provoking me some more, and that's when we started an exchange of personal attacks. I was blocked for 72 hrs for personal attacks, and he was blocked for 2 weeks, as he is a repeat offender. After his block expired, things cooled down, and I haven't heard anything from him so far. But, not ten minutes ago, Emir Arven has restarted with his provocative and offensive edits/behaviour (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:58.165.126.167&diff=prev&oldid=113551051 here], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&diff=prev&oldid=113551196 here], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&diff=prev&oldid=113551775 here]. I am asking if an administrator (or maybe more) could step in, and tell the user to stop falsely accusing, stop provoking, and maybe tell him to read [[WP:CIVIL]] and [[WP:NPA]]. I would also like all the personal attacks this user has made against me on his talk page and elsewhere be removed, in accordance with Wikipedia policy. Please help, because when I'm in situations like these, I can't help but retaliate, and that would just result in bad results for me.

:I have found new evidence that he still continues his sockpuppet behaviour, so I told him that I would report him if he continued:

:He told me once: ''Whenever I see an edit made by a fanatical Bosniak user, I will be sure to include your user name in the edit summary.'', and immidiately he went to [[Srebrenica Genocide]] and [[Alija Izetbegović]] articles to provoke. He didn't read the articles, but he reverted it immediately in order to provoke. I asked him about IP address and he didn't answer me. But continued to provoke. Here is another earlier case that proves this, just compare his address [http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17 58.165.126.17] and his edit[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17 58.165.126.17].

As for teh IP address, '''I was the one who even gave him the WHOIS link above''' - he did not start with a question about the IP - I started that discussion with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Emir_Arven&diff=next&oldid=107284086 this edit], where I sarcastically tell him that the anon could not be me, as I live hundreds of kilometers away from where it's IP is lcoated.

===Report on Emir===
Now I must say, [[:Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Ivan Kricancic|creating sockpuppet pages]] with '''absolutely no proof or evidence''' is in very bad taste. These pages must be deleted until your unfounded accusations that came out of nowhere prove true - which won't happen because [[User:Emir Arven|you]] are a perennial liar. This whole thing started because of a provocation by Emir, and now Emir just will not stop with the attacks, lies and falsifications. I am ''yet again'' asking that a good admin step in, and remove all the personal attacks/falsifications/provocations directed against me by [[User:Emir Arven]]. He cannot hide under the guise of doing good for Wikipedia with personal attacks like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bosniak&diff=prev&oldid=107274996 this] - which translated means

''[[Ustasa|Ustašoids]] in action''

''I want to warn you, that user Ivan Kricancic, look at his user page,in his mad fanatism goes from one picture related to Bosnia to another, and suggests their deletion. Often he does that unsigned: 58.165.115.192. I know it is hard to deal with assholes, but the moron is sick and in this manner he had deleted a lot of articles about Srebrenica also.''

This is insulting and provocative beyond belief - yet this, and many more attacks like it, have not been removed, and he has not yet been warned or punished for posting the above message numerous times.

Also, notice his [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Emir_Arven block log].

'''Seven''' blocks for heavy edit warring, many personal attacks, and rampant incivility.

Now, let's examine some of his edits and edit summaries:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=War_in_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina&diff=prev&oldid=113552174 Claiming an edit which has stood for ages as "false" without any evidence, and of a generally provocative nature.]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breakup_of_Yugoslavia&diff=prev&oldid=113552390 Here], where his racist tendencies are shown - he claims a source is invalid '''purely because it was written by a ''[[Serb]]''.
'''
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breakup_of_Yugoslavia&diff=prev&oldid=113552390 A page move] which is provocative in many ways to people involved in the article (those who are not "on his side")
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alija_Izetbegovi%C4%87&diff=prev&oldid=112427674 2nd edit after his most recent block]. Immediately jumps straight back into edit warring, and '''removes a huge section about a war crimes investigation''' on the man.
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Me%C5%A1a_Selimovi%C4%87&diff=prev&oldid=113564446 A regular victim of his warring]. With this edit, he reverts a version that was a compromise version between warring parties, and shows that he is unwilling to compromise.
:Also on the same article, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Me%C5%A1a_Selimovi%C4%87&diff=113551639&oldid=113533413 this edit] which he writes "this is ok", which it simply is not, because he has removed all references to the man being Serb - another example of his racism.
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=7th_Muslim_Brigade&diff=112819217&oldid=112646786 7th Muslim brigade]. Another article in which he '''removes sourced information''' and edit wars in, so he can try to paint a rosy picture of "his side".
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:58.165.126.167&diff=prev&oldid=113551051 This one!] Imagine begin the anonymous user, and BAM, out of nowhere some guy just reverts your edits, then goes "Ivan, is that you?".
*I don't need a link for this one, as the edit is what you see up above there written by [[User:Emir Arven|him]]. Reproducing the same attacking and provocative bullshit that he has written about me elsewhere - if that's not an insult, then you can also blow up the [[Western Wall]] and expect teh Jews to be happy.

Now consider his editing patterns, his mannerisms and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Emir_Arven his block log], then take a look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Ivan_Kricancic my block log]. I was blocked once for vandalizing a real life friend of mine's user page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Robz0r&diff=prev&oldid=44023899] (which was wrong, but in retaliation to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ivan_Kricancic&diff=prev&oldid=44011388 this]). And my other block was as a result of me making personal attacks against [[user:Emir Arven|Emir Arven]] after he provoked, harassed and attacked me. Now make a judgment over which editor is more trustworthy. I will ask again, please delete/remove his personal attacks/provocations/insults, warn the user not to do it, and possibly block him - in my opinion (judging by the numerous blocks, edit wars, slander, personal attacks, insults, provocations, and racism from this user) an indefinite block would suffice, but one of you admins may be more tolerant than I am, so a one or two month block would do if an indef is not made. Please read this, and do something about this vandalistic troll.

Let me repeat the summary of this whole situation: Ivan's second account [[User:Rts_freak|Rts_freak]] was blocked indefinitely and he was strongly warned by [[User:AnonEMouse|AnonEMouse]]. You can see that here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/Ivan_Kricancic Ivan Kricancic - sock puppet]. Ivan had second account which he created in order to nominate Bosniak-related pictures for deletion providing false information about the authors. He is an ethnic Croat, so he created the second account presenting himself to be an ethnic Bosniak who doesn't speak Bosnian, because he is from Australia. According to his user page (original user page) he hates Bosniaks, and makes funny of them. So his "ethnic Bosniak" account was blocked and he was warned. I noticed similar behaviour from the above IP addresses on Bosniak-related topics. Here is another earlier case that proves this, just compare his address [http://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=58.165.126.17 58.165.126.17] and his edit 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.165.126.17 58.165.126.17] in his original user page.  

About his Bosniak-image obsession, here are some examples when he was logged in:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bosniaks&diff=prev&oldid=83627378]
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Srebrenica_massacre&diff=prev&oldid=95269086]

(It should be noted that he first nominated those pictures for deletion)

And here is an example how he put false information when he was not logged in, about the Bosniak-related picture in order to nominate it for deletion:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Markale.jpg&diff=prev&oldid=107251063]

And here is an example when he promoted his ideas using his second blocked account, [[User:Rts_freak|Rts_freak]]:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3ASarajevo6.jpg&diff=82810189&oldid=40603570]

The worst thing is that he wrote lies about other users who donated pictures to Wikipedia. He said:

''This image was unlikely to have been taken by [[User:Asim Led|Asim Led]]. He has a history of providing dubious sources, and lying about source info. Impropper licence. Since the image is probably unfree, it is also missing a fair use rationale.''

Now, I want to show you few edits, just about Bosniaks and Bosnian language, he really hates them, when he was not logged in:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Bosniaks&diff=prev&oldid=107244478]

== Uncivil userbox? ==

I came across an entry on a babel userbox that I'm a bit curious about. Which states: ''This user does not wish to speak or hear dumbass, but is resigned to the necessity of at least understanding it in an environment of massive collaboration.''. To me it seems a bit off to be be referring to all your fellow community members as potential dumbasses. It seems to have been put in the template with this code: ''':UBX/du-1''' but I have no idea where to find that. Can anyone offer some insight?--[[User:Crossmr|Crossmr]] 17:53, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:It appears that the userpage which it is on [[User:UBX|UBX]], is in existence simply to host userboxes. The userbox you refer to, I assume, is here: [[User:UBX/du-1]].

What's the simplest procedure? thanks! [[User:Richard Myers|Richard Myers]] 05:56, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

== Continuous Problems with [[User:Rollosmokes]] ==

[[User:Rollosmokes]] seems to have a problem with working with other Wikipedia users, He has been making unwaranted reverts and then when questioned about it he becomes very aggressive and eventually gets into long edit wars and leaving aggressive messages on user talk pages including my own ([[User_talk:They call me Mr. Pibb|see here]]) which includes:

"Unless you want to get administration involved once more, stop making the nitpicky changes to the Metromedia article, as you have been doing for the past two days. I promise you that every time you revert to your changes, I will undo them. They aren't necessary, and as I have stated before, the article was FINE before you decided to FIX WHAT WASN'T BROKEN. Rollosmokes 07:29, 8 March 2007 (UTC)"
and

As a result [[User:Rollosmokes]] was suspended for a 24h period by [[User:Firsfron]] effective 15:54, 27 February 2007 (UTC), His request to have the ban lifted was denied by [[User:Sandstein]] on 19:55, 27 February 2007 (UTC). Following the expiration of he posted another aggressive message on my talkpage which stated:

"Since you insist on making these needless and redundant changes to the article (and are trying to prove a point by doing so), I have once again asked Firsfron to interject. I am also requesting that the Metromedia article be locked and protected from editing until this crap dies down. Rollosmokes 06:30, 9 March 2007 (UTC)"

Following that post he was edit blocked again, this time for 48h by [[User:Sandstein]] starting on 21:29, 9 March 2007 (UTC), [[User:Sandstein]]'s explanation for the edit block was as follows:

"You are blocked for 48h for editwarring on [[Metromedia]]; see revert [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metromedia&diff=113255991&oldid=113214658 1], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metromedia&diff=113524151&oldid=113385343 2], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metromedia&diff=113606345&oldid=113529028 3], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Metromedia&diff=113775368&oldid=1136614344 4]. Please note that neither you nor any group of which you are a part [[WP:OWN|owns any particular article]], as you seem to assume judging from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jorobeq&diff=prev&oldid=113777386 this comment]. Please engage in discussion on the talk page about why the format you prefer is better, rather than editwarring about it."

and following the expiration of that edit ban he started making aggressive reverts on the article [[Soul Train]], When [[User:TMC1982]] asked [[User:Rollosmokes]] to stop reverting people's edits on the Soul Train article [[User:Rollosmokes]] again became aggressive and posted the following message:

"First of all, I never labelled any changes on the Soul Train article as vandalism. Secondly, the extra subsectioning in your version messed up the continuity of the text, and is otherwise unnecessary. That was my reason for reverting back, and I will reiterate again that I did not label your edit as "vandalism". When my block is lifted, I will change it back. Rollosmokes 06:41, 10 March 2007 (UTC)"

In response [[User:TMC1982]] posted

"What you call "messed up continuity", I call breaking the article down in sections for easier reading. You don't exactly "own" the Soul Train page!!!TMC1982 2:28 p.m., 10 March 2007 (UTC)"

Clearly [[User:Rollosmokes]] has some anger and aggression issues that he needs to deal with and the fact that he feels he has the right to revert any article in Wikipedia without question because he deems them not up to his own personal standards instead of Wikipedia's standards. I would like to recommend that he be edit blocked for a period no less then 14 days after which he will be required to have a Wikipedia mentor who will look after him and guide him along on what he should and shouldn't do and what is proper and what is not proper.

== Glyphosate ==

Hi there,

Anon Ip [[User:83.78.136.13]] has started making massive POV edits to [[Glyphosate]], it is highly likely that this is a sockpuppet of [[User:Benjiwolf]] who has been blocked before for disruptive editing in general as on this page - see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Benjiwolf]. 

Note that their massive edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glyphosate&diff=114175816&oldid=114175233] removes some useful info, adds some useful info, but mostly seeks to push a particular POV on the article e.g. at the most basic it is not a discussion of Glyphosate anymore but of [[Roundup]]. From the their contributions [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/83.78.136.13] it can be seen that this editor is obviously experienced with Wikipedia, e.g. of trying to bait me into a [[WP:3R]] - [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lethaniol&diff=prev&oldid=114176528].

I suggest an outside user please comment on [[User:83.78.136.13]]s actions, maybe semi-protection of the page is in order, and an investigation into the sockpuppet issue. Cheers [[User talk:Lethaniol|Lethaniol]] 00:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

* It should be noted that Vintagekits has made some very offensive comments in the past week regarding British people.

== copyvio on [[Atlantis]] ==

That diff includes about six revisions; I've reverted to a previous version, but should those edits be deleted from the page history? The author helpfully provided the url of the story in his edit.

== [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]]'s probation ==

I would like to be clarified regarding the current status of [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]]'s [[Wikipedia:Community_sanction/Log#Gene_Nygaard_is_banned_from_non_consensual_article_moves_until_further_notice|community probation]]. Quoting Gene himself about it, "the page (...) has a big notice a the top: This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained primarily for historical interest". Does the fact that the community sanction page is now tagged as inactive mean that the probations contained therein are void? Gene's probation clearly states that "Gene Nygaard is banned from non consensual article moves until further notice". If the ban is still active, then Gene has been constantly disrespecting it, according to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=move&user=Gene+Nygaard&page= his move log]. Namely, Gene's been moving articles with the well-known purpose of wiping diacritics off their names. Recent examples of this are [[Wanda Gág]] to [[Wanda Gag]][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wanda_Gag&diff=113354283&oldid=100802251], [[Eggert Jónsson]] to [[Eggert Jonsson]][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eggert_J%C3%B3nsson&diff=112831721&oldid=112759712], [[Zoran Petrović]] to [[Zoran Petrovic]][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoran_Petrovi%C4%87&diff=108852090&oldid=108850522], among others. Particularly interesting is [[Šuligoj Roman]] to [[Roman Suligoj]][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%C5%A0uligoj_Roman&diff=111480638&oldid=111480368], where Gene states that the reason for the move was "order per naming conventions", not forgetting though to deface the name by removing the diacritic in the process.<br>
I reminded Gene of his probation [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AGene_Nygaard&diff=113855966&oldid=113721592], but unsurprisingly Gene replied with his typical strategy of launching random accusations. I kindly request a review by the community regarding Gene's actions and current status of his probation.--<strong><font style="color: #082567">[[User:Husond|Hús]]</font>[[User:Husond/Esperanza|<font color="green">ö</font>]]<font style="color: #082567">[[User talk:Husond|nd]]</font></strong> 03:47, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:See [[Talk:Wanda Gag]] for an example of Husond's shenanigans here.  

:Furthermore, the previous discussion dealt with only moving articles which didn't have the proper  redirects from the English language spelling.  I have not done that since.  Instead, I point out to the editors of those articles the need for creating such redirects by using the maintenance [[:Category:Articles needing redirects]].

:Note also that Husond tries to deceptively hide the fact that he is perpetually pushing the inclusion of diacritics where they do not belong, as he did [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Arpad_Elo&diff=88439259&oldid=88424123 here] in the case of [[Arpad Elo]] who spelled his name that way for 80 years as a U.S. citizen, and for whom the only evidence of any other spelling he may have used was not the [[Árpád Élő]] spelling he was pushing, but rather the [[Arpád Éllő]] spelling used on the ship's manifest when he came to America as a kid. [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 04:32, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

::Shenanigans, ooooh. Why do you keep bringing up [[Árpád Élő]], the one and only move proposal that pleased you (and solely because nobody could find reliable online records of his Hungarian name)? Should I cast tens of examples of move proposals where you fought an uphill battle and lost after wasting everybody's time and patience? Not here.--<strong><font style="color: #082567">[[User:Husond|Hús]]</font>[[User:Husond/Esperanza|<font color="green">ö</font>]]<font style="color: #082567">[[User talk:Husond|nd]]</font></strong> 05:03, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:::Reliable records of his Hungarian name are irrelevant, and you know it. There was oodles of evidence that "Arpad Elo" was the name always used in his publications, and always used in reference to the [[Elo rating system]] in chess for which he is famous (except for places corrupted by Wikipedia). That rating system is the reason he is notable enough for a Wikipedia article in the first place.  Note that even the rabid diacritics fanatics like Husond have never tried to move that to [[Élő rating system]]; in fact, even they realize that there is absolutely no need for even a redirect from that, because it is '''never''' used, just as Arpad Elo never used any other spelling for the last 80 years of his life.  That is one of tens or hundreds of cases where bad moves have been reversed.  Our article is at [[Ho Chi Minh]] and not at at [[Hồ Chí Minh]] (which is of course a redirect).  You are just a sore loser, Husond, because you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Amer_Delic&diff=109960613&oldid=109245170 argued unsuccessfully] for retaining improper names in cases such as [[Amer Delic]] and others.

:::And then you have the gall to come here and try to pull the wool over the eyes of the people here, trying to falsely imply that when a name is or was sometimes written with diacritics that the version with diacritics is always the proper one to use, and that if it is written with a varying number of letters with diacritics, the version with the most diacritics is the proper one.  Why in the world are you so hell-bound on eliminating the use of the English language on the English Wikipedia in any case?  Why you consistently claim that there is some error in using the English alphabet when writing in English?  We may choose to use diacritics in many of the names here on Wikipedia, but we do not do so because it is incorrect not to do so in English.  Rather, we are choosing among legitimate alternatives.

:::Note also that Husond was the one who unblocked [[User:Darwinek]] when he was blocked for personal attacks against me at the same time as Darwinek make the improper block against me to gain advantage in a content dispute, which was reversed as discussed at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive182#Improper blocking by Darwinek]].  Husond puts his blinders on when it comes to abuses of admin powers as well as the violations of the rule against personal attacks by his fellow admin who has helped out with many of these undiscussed, unreferenced and improper moves, but for some reason has a vendetta against me.  [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 15:52, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:The community-imposed probation holds no matter where the discussion occurred. Just because [[WP:PAIN]] does not exist anymore doesn't mean that personal attack complaints/reports posted there in the past were not legitimate and now void. I remark only on the procedure, not the dispute itself. --<sup>[[User talk:Physicq210|<font color="000000">210</font>]]</sup>'''[[User:Physicq210|<font color="#0000C0" face="Comic Sans MS">physicq</font>]]''' (''[[Special:Contributions/Physicq210|<font color="#0000C0">c</font>]]'') 04:42, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

Furthermore, [[User:Husond]], maybe you'd like to discuss [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pal_Benko&diff=89475446&oldid=89457702 this improper, unreferenced and unexplained move] '''by you''' of [[Pal Benko]] to [[Pál Benkő]], which was of course later reversed and moved back where it belongs without the diacritics, in a [[Wikipedia:requested moves|requested moves]] discussion which didn't even need my participation or even any awareness of it on my part to come to the proper conclusion. I haven't ever edited either that article or its talk page. [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 17:17, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

:I think maybe you both should step away from the issue (and each other), as all of this is turning into a bit of a war. I'm sure the diacritics will work themselves out without the two of you for a short time until you can both cool off.

:That said, I do find that moving a page over another Admin's block as [[User:Jonathunder]] did, or in spite of a community probation against such activity, as [[User:Gene Nygaard]] did, is not a particularly productive way to ensure that we all have the best Wikipedia we can. Just a random editor's opinion. [[User:Ryanjunk|Ryanjunk]] 21:09, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

::If, as Husond claims, he was merely reverting on the basis that I had violated the earlier discussion (which I totally dispute), then what in the hell cause does he, or you, have to complain about an independent determination to move it on the basis fo the facts of the case, whether it is by [[User:Jonathunder]] or any other editor whatsoever?  If [[User:Husond]] wasn't making a determination to revert on the basis of the facts of the case, then it remains an open field. 

:: Furthermore, if instead Husond was indeed basing his move on the facts of the case, then in light of the fact that it had already been pointed out that the previous move was '''unreferenced, undiscussed, and controversial''', then it was incumbent upon [[User:Husond]] to engage in that discussion, to cite his reasons and see if anyone else agreed or disagreed, before making the move.  '''Husond did not do so.'''  He can't have it both ways.  [[User:Gene Nygaard|Gene Nygaard]] 22:40, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

== Abuse of Admin privileges by [[User Talk:Yannismarou|Yannismarou]] ==

{{archive top}}
There has been an ongoing discussion for over a week about whether it is correct to call Sparta a [[superpower]] in the introduction to the article [[Sparta]]. Essentially the argument against is that the introduction links to the article [[superpower]] which identifies a country with the ability to "project power on a worldwide scale", which I believe is not correct when applied to Sparta. The argument for is that there are cited references that mention that Sparta was a superpower.

As a compromise I offered that the text calling Sparta a superpower be moved down to within the article where there would be other text detailing Sparta's victories and defeats, for example see this [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&diff=113841121&oldid=113797011].

Those favoring retention of the word superpower are Greek (ethinicity or residents) [[User:Domitius]], and [[User:NikoSilver]], and possibly Greek editor [[User:Miskin]]. Editor Miskin does not have information on personal page, but the vast majority of his last 5,000 edits involve Greece. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=5000&target=Miskin] 

Those who believe it is inappropriate to call Sparta a superpower include [[User:Dejvid]] (native language English), [[User:Gardener_of_Geda]] (Scot), [[User:Mehrshad123]] (likely Iranian), [[User:Twospoonfuls]] (speaks English and Russian), [[User:Hodgetts]] (unknown nationality/ethnicity), [[User:A.Garnet]] (likely Turkish) and me [[User:Nayan_Nev]] (from India). 

The entire discussion can be found at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sparta]. Here is a time sequence of the posts I regard as important.

:[[User:Yannismarou]], who is Greek, joined this discussion about 24 hours back with a post [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&diff=113887762&oldid=113883601] replying to a post by me asking for a RfC or consensus [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=prev&oldid=113842152]. His very first post was critical of me, saying "I think that your interpretation of "consensus" is a bit strange" and "I think that you are the one who should provide consensus supporting your view, and not the editors who defend the current and established version of the lead". 

:When I asked if the latter was Wiki policy [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&diff=113900176&oldid=113888236] I did not receive a reply from Yannismarou. 

:Later he launched a personal attack upon me with innuendoes about my lack of politeness and honesty [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&diff=114068143&oldid=114067898]

:NikoSilver proposed a text which would retain the word [[superpower]] in the introduction [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&diff=114086144&oldid=114085986]. 

:Yannismarou approved of NikoSilver's suggestion, calling it "Nico's great proposal" [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&diff=114087354&oldid=114087180]. 

:I objected to this suggestion as it did not address the basic point of the debate (describing Sparta as a [[superpower]]). [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114087604]. 

:Yannismarou then claimed that I did not understand "superpower" was not much different from "hegemon" and that I was the only one objecting to NikoSilver's suggestion [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114088438]. This is simply misleading as between NikoSilver's suggestion at 16:56 and Yannismarou's post at 17:12 there had elapsed about a quarter of an hour. During this short interval of time others editors objecting to the word [[superpower]] had not posted, but that does not mean they had changed their minds. I explained as much by this post [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114089936]. 

:At which point Yannismarou accused me of being disruptive [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114091467]. 

:My next two posts said I would accept the text proposed by A. Garnet as a compromise [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114091747] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=prev&oldid=114092881]. 

:After that Yannismarou blocked me for violating WP:POINT! Essentially the last two posts I could post said I was ready to accept text suggested by another person (A.Garnet) as a compromise, and this according to Yannismarou constituted grounds for blocking me.

:After blocking me Yannismarou began a section titled "Closing the Discussion" [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114094632]. So he was silencing my disagreement with him by blocking me, and then moving on to "closing the discussion."

:Saying that the word "superpower" had been correctly used (essentially the basic point of the unsettled debate) [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114105972] Yannismarou unprotected the article and inserted the text suggested by NikoSilver [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&diff=114109876&oldid=114102810].

:When my block expired I challenged the correctness of Yannismarou's block [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114107265] (at 18:45) upon which he reverted the article back to its previous version [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&diff=next&oldid=114102810] (at 18:52). 

Essentially Yannismarou took one side of the debate, accused me of being disruptive when I said I did not agree with the version he approved, blocked me, unprotected the article, changed the article to the version he approved, then self-reverted the article after being challenged by me when the block had expired.

I believe the evidence clearly shows my posts did not violate WP:POINT and Yannismarou abused his Admin privileges by blocking me for disagreeing with him on the appropriateness of using the word [[superpower]] to describe Sparta.

:Checking Nayan Nev's edit history, it seems that (s)he edited the main article [[Sparta]] only moderately (plus a bit of reverting vandalism), always including detailed edit comments. I did not see any 3RR violation.  Most related contributions were on [[Talk:Sparta]], trying to resolve the dispute through discussion, where I did not see any inappropriate language. In light of this, it seems the block through Yannismarou was in rush, as I did not see a [[WP:POINT]] violation as indicated in the block log, definitely not an ''egregious disruption''.

::It's perhaps worth pointing out that Admin ''Yannismarou'' later "regretted" blocking ''Nayan Nev'', though he also said he had "no alternative". I, myself, took no part in the actual article reversions, but my opinion (as an interested observer of the goings-on) is that ''NN'' has been quite seriously harassed and bullied by other editors simply because he dared to suggest that any reference to a Greek city-state being a "superpower" was inappropriate.

As an outside observer and non-admin, I think this block was extremely inappropriate. Yannismarou was clearly involved in a content dispute with NN, and he blocked him for violating [[WP:POINT]]. Looking at the talk page, there was no disruption from NN who was calmly and rationally presenting his side of the debate. In fact his last edit before being blocked was to agree with another editor on the other side of the conflict. It looks like Yannismarou doesn't understand the blocking policy or [[WP:POINT]]. [[User:AniMate|AniMate]] 01:24, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

: Totally inappropriate use of admin tools by Yannismarou. Admins are not suppose to use their admin tools when they're in content dispute with other editors, to threaten and bully the other side into accepting their POV.

This appears to be a textbook case of blocking to gain advantage in a content dispute.  There was no violation of [[WP:POINT]] as claimed, as far as I can tell, nor [[WP:CIVIL]] or [[WP:AGF]].  All of that said, there's no reason right now to apply MORE admin power to this situation.  Yannismarou, please be aware that you have a lot of people looking over your shoulder right now.  Everyone else there: civil discussion on the talk page does not require that you all agree on something.  Nor does consensus - one person or a small group can't keep there from being a consensus of a majority of others.  But you are expected to tolerate civil and polite disagreement and advocacy from those with other content opinions.  Failure to do so is violation of AGF.  Serious violations of AGF are blockable.  NN does not get a free pass to winning the content dispute for having been improperly blocked, either.  [[User:Georgewilliamherbert|Georgewilliamherbert]] 07:02, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:Yanni's a friend of mine, so I may be a bit biased here, but I'd ask that people take a look at as much of that talk page as they can find time for before handing down judgement like this. While I agree that the block was probably hasty, I don't think it was intended to gain advantage in a content dispute.  Rather, I think it was a case of frustration with a discussion in which NN had yet to bring a single source to the table, arguing instead from his (often seriously inaccurate) understanding of the period over an inordinately long discussion (it took me over half an hour to read through it just now).  Looking at that talk page as a student of the period, NN's posts are essentially hollow argumentation, and his persistence in rehashing the issue had reached the point that he was getting on people's cases when they tried to take the discussion in a somewhat more interesting and fruitful direction.  Although a block from Yannismarou was probably not appropriate in the circumstances, I can't really blame him for trying to restore usability to a talk page that was being appropriated in this way. --[[User:Robth|Robth]]<sup>[[User Talk:Robth|Talk]]</sup> 08:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
::I had no contact with Yanni before, but I would also like to hear his comments first before condemning his actions. Admins are also humans, and as such make failures on occasions. A call for desysopping is IMHO not yet appropriate unless there are multiple similar abuses.

:::If you read once again carefully the course of the discussion you will see that more than once, NN interrupted an ongoing discussion with other users in order to promote his point. I warned him once, and I told him that blocking is not my first option here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&diff=114091527&oldid=114091281]. Before my comment there you can see what this user was kept doing all the time [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ASparta&diff=114091527&oldid=114091281]. A discussion was on with A.Garnet about a part of the lead in discussion, and NN not caring at all started a new section in order to promote his point! Nobody else was there for him!! Nobody else's intervention mattered!!! Only him and the promotion of his own opinion. Before my blocking, NN did exactly the same thing: disruption of an ongoing discussion, interruption of its course (because he did not like it) and starting of a new section [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sparta#Garnet.27s_Proposal_for_Compromise here] with the imposition of his own positions. He did not care that the above discussion was still ongoing! No!! This did not matter for him!!! And why all that? Because he ''had to'' promote his point.<br> 
:::If you think that my blocking was improper, I respect your opinion, and I can live with it. But I stand firm that I did the right thing at this particular moment. At least, during NN's blocking we had a proper discussion without the unconstructive participation of a user who disrespected all his co-editors there by interrupting their ongoing discussions in the most impolite and contemptuous way. After all, my blocking of NN was not punitive, it lasted just one hour, and its own purpose was to serve the efforts for the reaching of consensus. I'm sorry consensus was not reached, but thanks to my decision we came too close to an agreement. NN's activity was definitely disruptive and falls under the scope of [[WP:POINT]].

The protesting user is repeatedly making a case against policy. He has been violating [[WP:NOR]] and [[WP:POINT]], by constantly bringing up a resolved issue. He has been [[WP:SPAM]]ming for support to irrelevant/unaware users (some of which have expressed their opinion here too). What tipped the bucket, IMO, is that he persistently misinterpreted/ignored the position of others ([[straw man]]), by "playing fool". His main "dispute" (if we can call that such a lame issue of wording) was that the word "superpower" should either be replaced or limited to within the boundaries of Ancient Greece. When a compromise proposal was made that addressed his concern by replacing plain "superpower" with "superpower of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek world]]", he pretended repeatedly that he does not understand the difference (that he himself had requested). He constantly misinterpreted other peoples comments and equated the two. Note that the word "superpower" for Sparta is [[Talk:Sparta#Supersources|sourced to exhaustion]]. I am sorry to see that he keeps twisting and equating the two wordings also here, continuing to "play fool". To add, Yanni is one of the most worthy contributors with multiple featured contributions, and one of the calmest people I've seen around in disputes. I endorse this block, and there is much more than plain "content dispute" in it. Note how many times he posted and reposted the same "playing fool" request, even after he was asked with the politest way to stop, so that we could resolve another more serious issue and come back to it lated.

:I was involved in this dispute. I suggested a few compromises which avoided the term superpower but made reference to Sparta's pre-eminent position in Ancient Greece. NN had accepted two of my compromises. I do not believe NN's block was warranted or helpful. I made no comment on this during the discussion because I thought perhaps NN had a history as disruptive user (people were citing [[WP:NOFEEDING]]), but this does not seem to be the case. It seems he was blocked because a number of Greek editors saw his opposing view as an annoyance, but what makes it worse is that NN actually agreed to both of my compromises, whilst they were rejected by the other disputants. Furthermore, I was definintely not pleased with Yannis using his admin powers to implement Niko's version while we were in the midst of a debate, though he recognised this and reverted himself later. But the point is his admin powers were not used constructively (or fairly) in this dispute. Sorry Yannis, you are a level headed and capable editor, but this is precisely why I was the only person to have [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Yannismarou&diff=prev&oldid=101908472 opposed] your adminship, knowing your tendency to fall on the side of Greek editors all too often. --[[User:A.Garnet|A.Garnet]] 12:33, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

I also tried to place the use of the word "superpower" within the right context. Your proposal would be acceptable by me, but as you saw other users did not accept it. At the same time the term "military superpower of the ancient Greek World" was acceptable by the above users and me as well, but it was rejected by you and NN.

::About my implementation of Nicos' proposal: at this moment I thought that a better wording (even without consensus) clarifying the Sparta-Persia balance of power and the meaning of "superpower" (not world but limited hellenic dimensions in this case) was much much better than the previous inaccurate edit under protection. After I edited it, I realised that NN and other users who insist on the removal of "superpower" will keep insisting on the (trivia for me) issue of "superpower", and will not accept my edit accusing me again for abuse of adm power. That is why, I decided to revert to the protected text, and not to be accused of violating any policies. Yes, it terms of policy my editing was wrong; but in terms of encyclopedic accuracy it was towards the correct direction. So, the final solution (revert to the protected text) is in accord with WP policies but it is against historical and scientific accuracy and content quality! This is the problem here!! We keep the bad protected text, because even a better text version is attacked and consensus is not reached.--[[User:Yannismarou|Yannismarou]] 13:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

I am seeing the same thing from Yannismarou here that I saw in the Sparta talk page, that is disagreement with him being labeled as disruption. He now says that starting a new section (to offer compromises) is disruptive, though he himself started new sections (like "Nico's great proposal" or "Concluding the discussion"). Basically he took upon himself to find a "consensus" with NikoSilver and objected to me offering an opinion during the process. This is simply censorship.

Looking at Yannismarou's logs, I see that he has only blocked two other registered users (and many anonymous users). The first one is a obvious block for vandalism, the next one is more relevant to this case. The editor [[User:Laertes_d]] was blocked by Yannismarou on 10:22, 3 February 2007. I do not condone Laertes_d's behavior, especially his posts ''after'' being blocked. The block no doubt infuriated him. The similarity to the existing situation is that this user too had been involved in a content dispute with Yannismarou. Referenced text in the article by Laertes_d had been removed by Yannismarou [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Fire_of_Smyrna&diff=105117063&oldid=105116999%20this%20reversion] with a generic explanation of "revert all POV". When [[User:Richardshusr]] questioned Yannismarou why he had removed referenced text [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Great_Fire_of_Smyrna&diff=prev&oldid=105158714] he received no reply [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARichardshusr&diff=114245239&oldid=114244455]. All this was prior to Laertes_d being blocked, so Yannismarou was fully immersed in a content dispute before he blocked Laertes_d. Once again I do not condone the abrasive behavior by Laertes_d, but there was some of that on both sides, but only one got blocked. 

Georgewilliamherbert pointed me to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BLOCK#When_blocking_may_not_be_used where it says "Blocking to gain an advantage in a content dispute is strictly prohibited. Sysops must not block editors with whom they are currently engaged in a content dispute. If in doubt, report the problem to other admins to act on." It is instructive to note that Yannismarou disregarded the directive to report any problem he saw to other admins. This happened in 2 of 3 situations he has ever blocked a registered user.

So where does all this leave us? For the integrity of Wikipedia processes I think this should be resolved now rather than later.  Yannismarou maintains that he did no wrong and that "NN's activity was definitely disruptive and falls under the scope of WP:POINT." even after neutral admins Chris and Georgewilliamherbert and neutral editor [[User:AniMate]] have told him otherwise. He says "I do not intend to apologize" and goes on to label me "a user who disrupted in the worst and most contemtuous way an ongoing discussion".

We have come a long way, so to leave this hanging is simply encouragement for similar behavior in the future. Here are some options:
:1) Yannismarou apologizes and agrees to in the future not use admin powers in Greek related articles.
OR
:2) As Yannismarou says he is an administrator open to recall, he acts upon it. As his admin actions have already been criticized by two neutral admins, I believe there is sufficient grounds for this.
OR
:3) Other Wiki processes are followed.

My point was not about the comparative behavior of the two parties, but Yannismarou's ignoring the Wiki directive to have a different admin block Laertes_d. As for my "edit warring" on the [[Republic of Macedonia]] page, I made one edit, was reverted saying there had been a vote, reverted back requesting the details of the vote, and then stopped editing on receiving the requested information. Essentially ONE edit and ONE revert, that's all I did. Judge for yourself if that qualifies as "edit-warring". [[User:Nayan Nev|NN]] 14:27, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

This is going to be the best for quality and accuracy, which are the only reasons I took the unpleasant and (as regarded by the majority of editors here, whose opinion  I take into serious consideration) wrong decision to block NN.--[[User:Yannismarou|Yannismarou]] 14:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Despite it's been said, Nayan Nev has been an extremely disruptive editor. He has been extensively edit-warring on the limit of 3RR[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&diff=112569953&oldid=112568605] and has invited Iranian users to edit-war on his POV. He has removed referenced information and has explicitely denied to abide by [[WP:ATT]] principles. He continues to randomly invite Iranian editors from Iran-related articles, who are apparently even more disruptive than him [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yannismarou&diff=prev&oldid=114238818] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMiskin&diff=114266661&oldid=114245986]. Some have POV-pusher and vandal past (see [[User_Talk:Immortals]]) and are basically invited [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sparta&curid=42968&diff=114206960&oldid=114180478] to edit war - following Nayan's reminder on 3RR [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMehrshad123&diff=113955623&oldid=113948645]. Yannismarou actually tried to speak in Nayan's stead in order to reach a mutually acceptable solution. Nayan kept attacking editors, starting new sections and trolling in a way I've never seen before, and all this during the others were trying to reach a consensus. Which forced me quit the conversation and Yannismarou put on him a one-hour block, only '''after explicit warning'''. The debate was basically started due to Nayan's incapability of respecting the [[WP:CITE]] policy and make edits our counter-edits that are based on credible sources. The article was basically locked as a result of Nayan's organised edit-warring[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sparta&diff=113955077&oldid=113954170] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMehrshad123&diff=113955623&oldid=113948645] [[User:Miskin|Miskin]] 15:43, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Yannis, just a few words from someone who highly respects your contributions to Wikipedia and supported your RFA.  I'm not going to plow through all the diffs or history, but this reads like the kind of situation that gives rise for concern.  As an admin, it is up to you to rise above it and set the example.  It is in no one's interest for this situation to escalate or fester.  My recommendation would be to apologize, and agree to call in another, less-involved admin if future disputes arise on Greek articles.  If there is in fact a problem with NN's contributions, that will eventually come to light.  I don't support a recall or sysop or ArbCom actions, because I believe you can/will respond reasonably.  I recently strongly-opposed another RfA candidate because I firmly believed he may use the tools to influence debate on certain country topics; this is not the kind of discussion that warms people's hearts.  Try to end this quickly, and learn from it.  All the best, [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font>]] ([[User talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk]]) 17:55, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:Well, gee, late to the party again;  I see I missed your apology above. I knew you'd do the right thing :-)  [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font>]] ([[User talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk]]) 18:04, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:The debate is a question of [[WP:ATT]] and not wikipedians' POV. The opposing side doesn't respect [[WP:CITE]] and [[WP:NOR]]. Also very few of the people mentioned above have ''ever'' participated in the actual editing of the article. They all appeared after Nayan's disruptive activity. None of them have presented counter-sources on the question at hand. In my opinion (POV alert) there are only very few of those editors who can be considered as non-partisans, the rest have found themselves there as a result of wp:vendettas and wp:stalking. As shown in the diffs below, Mehrshad was invited by Nayan_Nev to openly start an edit-war, so was User:Immortans and who knows how many others. A. Garnet has never shown interest in the particular article, nor in any related article, nor has he ever proved himself knowledgeable on the topic. He appeared soon after he had a conflict with Domitius in a different article, [[Cypriot Civil War]] I think, where he received a block. And now, there you see him, pretending to be a completely neutral participant. This demonstrates how exploitable dispute-resultion method and wp:policy are. Nobody really respects the policies, not even old users, and unreferened POV is powerful enough to cause all this. Half of the people participating in [[Talk:Sparta]] have gotten there either by rv-war invitation or by stalking another users' contribution lists. None of them has _ever_ contributed in [[Sparta]], nor any related article - yet their unsourced opinion counts as much as real contributors' referenced opinion, and is causing all this trouble. This is a just _laughable_ - it reveals how easily a malicious editor can exploit all Policies and still be taken seriously, without offerring any contributions to wikipedia whatsoever. In the apogee of irony - he may even receive an apology! [[User:Miskin|Miskin]] 17:58, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
::In the interest of not escalating the situation, again, if there is a problem with NN's or anyone else's contributions, that will eventually come to light.  NPOV is hardly enforced on Wikipedia (Wiki's largest problem IMNSHO), but it's in no one's interest for an involved admin to be blocking; an uninvolved admin should do that.  Two wrongs (pervasive POV on Wiki, and involved admins blocking) don't make a right.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font>]] ([[User talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk]]) 18:08, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

I'm glad that at least one person is being realistic about this. I repeate, this debate is just '''laughabe'''. We wouldn't be even having it if half of the people involved could just take a minute and read [[WP:ATT]] and take it ''literally'' instead of metaphorically. Anyone who wants to make an edit needs to have a reference. Anyone who wants to challenge an edit or include an alternative opinion needs to have a counter-reference - there's no case of dispute otherwise. [[User:Miskin|Miskin]] 18:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

== Very-very-speedy deleting of an article ==

I created [[Notable usages of the phrase "I love you"]] with content MOVED from [[I love you]]. It took me only the time to go back to the original article and delete that content, to see that the new article had been tagged for speedy deletion with reason "content COPIED from another article". Since I believed that reason was not correct, I put in a hangon on the article and started writing the explanation on the Talk page. When I saved the explanation, the article had already been deleted. From creation to explanation, the whole process took less than half an hour.

I don't want to discuss the merits or demerits of the deleted article and of the killed contents, but I'm very, very annoyed at some overzealous admin who couldn't wait another minute to see my explanation and who thus made me waste my (voluntary and good-faith) time.

Even if this is an acceptable behavior under admin guidelines, it still shows lack of respect for other people's time and efforts and the guidelines should probably be readdressed. Thank you (but still annoyed). --[[User:Mafmafmaf|maf]] 01:00, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:According to [[WP:CSD]], editors are supposed to allow time for article expansion before tagging it.  Unfortunately, that is ignored a significant amount of the time and considering the backlog [[CAT:CSD]] normally has, it's usually not an option for the admin deleting it to check to ensure that enough time had been allowed.  Responsibility rests with the tagger, in my opinion.  I'm '''not at all''' a fan of an admin deleting a clearly good-faith article that is speedy-tagged with a {{tl|hangon}} without giving enough time for a discussion on the talk page (in this case, less than 3 minutes from {{tl|hangon}} to deletion by [[User:NawlinWiki|NawlinWiki]]).  From start to deletion, less than 16 minutes.  I agree that we can do better than this — the question is what needs fixing.  —[[User:Bbatsell|<span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span>]] [[User_talk:Bbatsell|<span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Bbatsell|<span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span>]] 01:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:::I disagree that responsibility rests with the tagger. I believe responsibility rests with the writer, to take the time outside of main name space to create something that will stand up to scrutiny from the get-go. Good faith or no, a half-baked article is still only half-baked, nd there are few guarantees the article will be improved after it hits namespace.

:: I think the problem is people want to tag now, rather than having to put "go back and check article X" on their calendar.  A solution may be to use {{tl|delayed}} (which I created recently).  For example, <code>&#123;{delayed|2007-03-16|2=&#123;{db-talk}}}}</code> can be used on a talk page so that {db-talk} will appear on 2007-03-16. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—[[User:Quarl|Quarl]] <sup>([[User Talk:Quarl|talk]])</sup> <small>2007-03-11 02:10Z</small></i></span>

::: Oooh, very intriguing template right there.  My concern at first blush, of course, is adding it and then not checking the article again, so that if, for example, the article is significantly expanded, it would still end up being tagged.  Obviously in this case one would hope that the admin wouldn't delete, but I've certainly seen ''lots'' of speedy deletions that have gone pretty clearly against policy.  —[[User:Bbatsell|<span style="color:#555;font-weight:bold;">bbatsell</span>]] [[User_talk:Bbatsell|<span style="color:#C46100;font-size:0.75em;">¿?</span>]] [[Special:Contributions/Bbatsell|<span style="color:#2C9191;">✍</span>]] 02:15, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

:::: Good point.

:::::I offer you this challenge: spend one evening on New Pages Patrol. My experience is that ten to fifteen percent of articles submitted are of such poor quality or are so frivolous (Damon Edwards is a l33t n00b and chicks dig him; The Wanking Shaggers are an up-and coming band...; Hamilton Heights School is a school in Prince Edward Island) that any reasonable editor would move to speedy-delete them. I read all articles on New Pages, and appreciate the fine quality of articles I often see. But I have no hesitation at all about nominating articles for speedy deletion that have nothing to contribute in terms of noteworthiness or serious intent. Please do not forget that I nominate them, but it takes a second editor to delete them. Please also do not forget that Wikipedia recieves literally thousands of articles an hour, and if there were no watchers at the gates, Wikipedia would quickly reach 15 million articles, most of them not suitable to line a bird cage. In the case of [[I love you]], the article was in fact copied. I don't care that the author claims he wrote the original piece, fact is, the breakout poage was an exact duplicate of what already existed in a very short article, and no breakout was necessary. Claims that it needs "assistance to grow" are frivolous - it is the main article that needs time to improve, not some clip-out copy. As far as [[Selective entry schools]] goes, I tagged it as a speedy because it was about two sentences long and contained nothing to assert notability. Criticising me for ignoring a <nowiki>{{hangon}}</nowiki> is kind of odd, because only the deleting editor would have seen that, and that was not me. Bottom line: if authors do not want their pages deleted, they need to put in the time outside main articlespace to create an article that will withstand initial scrutiny before submitting it.

== [[Essjay controversy]] ==

Serious Questions:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Gwen_Gale/Essjay_thing&oldid=113836085 ''(I mean, look what happened to Essjay, I feel bad for him). Gwen Gale 09:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)''] Are editors who are ''strong supportors'' of Essjay are allowed to edit the Essjay controversy article? Currently the quotes are gone from the Wales response and Essjay's response and there is an abnormally huge Reactions section. I could fix the clutter and improve the article. First, the quotes should be put back in the article. Second, the reactions section should be divided into two sections because it is undue weight to have such a long section. Third, someone recently changed a sentence that is now factually false in the Essjay letter's section. Fourth, a link to the offical "My response" of Essjay is of historical significance that belongs in the article. Fifth, many editors already wanted the images to stay in the article. Sixth, this is becoming a story within a story. Some editors want to delete the article. Since deletion is not possible. Then, they want to make the article cluttered, unreadable, and short as possible. Removing the images and the internal link is just some examples to shorten the article. The huge reactions section is just one example of clutter and improper structuring.  I do not know what is the next step is this kind of environment. Currently they are trying to suppress pictures of ''screenshots and images'' of Essjay's for no valid reason. A few minor cosmetic changes, organization, and direction will dramatically improve the article and flow of reading. It is amazing to try to edit in an environment which a group of editors have made their support for someone who is now retired. 

I do not know how to reason with a group of ediotrs in this kind of climate. Assistance and oversight is needed. What is the next step for this situation when the talk page will accoplish ''nothing.'' <span style="border: black 1px solid; padding:1px; background-color:#FFFFFF"><!--j00 4r3 0wN3d bY-->[[User:QuackGuru|<u><font color="DarkGreen">'''Q<small>uack</small>'''</font></u>]]<!-- -->[[Special:Contributions/QuackGuru|<u><font color="#999999">'''G<small>uru</small>'''</font></u>]] [[User_talk:QuackGuru|'''<sup>TALK</sup>''']]</span> 01:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

Remembering what I'd seen here about the acceptability of applying a block in such cases (that is, blatant personal attacks, even though one is involved in dispute with the culprit), I blocked him for three hours.  I think that the behaviour probably warranted a longer block, but I was hesitant because of my involvement (and at the time of the block I'd only seen the edit summary).  It seems to have had the desired effect, though, and [[User:John Kenney‎|John Kenney‎]] has acknowledged (up to a point) the unacceptability of his behaviour.

I've brought it here because another editor has expressed mild concern that I blocked at all.

== (anon. only, <small>'''account creation blocked'''</small>) ==

I notice that there are still a disturbing number of rather harmless usernameblocks that are being issued with ''account creation blocked'' checked off. I realize it's the default setting, but it's almost certainly going to chase away new users if they're told to create a new username, and then find themselves blocked from doing so.

== Block evasion by {{user|SndrAndrss}} ==

Okay, the backstory of this case will not be easy to explain, but I will make a try. {{userblock|SndrAndrss}} is a problematic user in many ways, but he also makes some useful contributions, which makes this case a little more difficult than other similar ones. To cite my [[Wikipedia:Administrators'_noticeboard/IncidentArchive152#Disruption block review|first report to ANI]] from late last year, "[SndrAndrss] has a history of not wanting to answer messages left as the user's talk page (or he is just not understanding that messages there are directed to him), even though this has been pointed out to him on several occations (see his [[User talk:SndrAndrss|talk page]])."

This has lead to several conflicts, mainly on a wide variety of templates where he has added parameters or changed the looks of the template without any consensus whatsoever, or has made incomprehensible edits (such as changing svg images to png, or removing borders around flags). After trying to initiate a discussion with him (either on the talk page of the template or on his user page), nothing happens, and a week later or so, he makes the same edit over again. A few examples of this behaviour:
*{{lt|Infobox Football club}}
*{{lt|Country data England}}
*{{lt|ENGf}}
*{{lt|Nordic skiing World Championships}}

As noted in my first incident report, I blocked him 48 hours for disruption on 6 December last year, and everyone that reviewed it agreed that it was justified. I had of course hoped that the short block would be a wake-up call for SndrAndrss to start communicating, but was I wrong. Only five days later, [[User:Morwen]] blocked him for a week for the same disrupting behaviour, and reported it [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/IncidentArchive155#SndrAndrss again|on ANI]]. Of course, a longer block didn't help either.

And as soon as he returned from the block, he had the same behaviour as before, and I blocked him for another week on 19 December. This time something actually happened. [[User talk:SndrAndrss#Unblocking|He promised to start communicating]], and I assumed good faith, and unblocked him. Of course nothing happened. He made som half-hearted attempts at communicating at various talk pages, but never answered any replies he got.

I wasn't very active in January, so I didn't keep an eye on him during that time, but when I returned, there were no signs of improvement. He was as disrupting as before, combining a few good edits with the undiscussed template edits or page moves. So, I blocked him for two weeks on 18 February this year. This time, it was discovered that he created new accounts to evade the block. In the middle of all this, he asked to be unblocked, a request that was of course declined.

Since the first of his sockpuppet accounts were blocked, he started editing anonymously which was confirmed in a [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/SndrAndrss|request for checkuser]]. All discovered accounts and IPs were blocked, but new ones keep showing up. They can be quite easily detected though, either as a variation on the form SndrAndrss##, or as IPs in the 88.88.xxx.xxx range. They are found by checking the waterholes, he almost exclusively edits articles related to football, the Olympics, skiing and rally. Sockpuppets and IPs include:
{{col-start}}
{{col-1-of-2}}
*{{user|SndrAndrss15}}
*{{user|SndrAndrss16}}
*{{user|SndrAndrss17}}
*{{user|SndrAndrss18}}
*{{user|SndrAndrss19}}
{{col-2-of-2}}
*{{user|SndrAndrss20}}
*{{user|88.88.42.199}}
*{{user|88.88.45.213}}
*{{user|88.88.47.236}}
{{col-end}}

His latest two week block has been restarted twice now as he has kept trying to evade it. I've run out of options now because I am not in the mood to play this game forever. Communication with SndrAndrss has failed, blocking him has failed, and I sincerely doubt that an [[WP:RFC|RFC]] or [[WP:RFAR|RFAR]] will do any good since he would probably not discuss or read anything there. What to do next? Since I've not seen a single user that thinks I've gone on too hard, more like the opposite, I find it unthinkable to just let him go and revert whatever he does that is not good. And indefblocking him would just lead to more sockpuppet accounts and a just as hard time finding and blocking them.

:It's certainly useful that he numbers his sockpuppets, which makes it trivial to confirm that he keeps evading his blocks. Persistently disruptive users such as he who show no inclination to communicate or cooperate with the community should simply be indefblocked, and their socks blocked and reverted on sight - which should be possible here given the vandal's narrow range of interests. He'll eventually go away. Accordingly, I'd support a community ban at this point. [[User:Sandstein|Sandstein]] 21:30, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

== Sock puppet accusations. ==

At [[Electronic voice phenomenon]] there has recently been editing from multiple IP addresses, and on the article talk page, editors [[User:Davkal]] and [[User:Martinphi]] have made the accusation that they are sock puppets of a registered editor.  Most recently, Martinphi made the following comment: '''"I suggest that we only edit versions of the article which are the last by an editor who is not a sock puppet. Thus, all sock puppetry will be useless. Also, let several sock versions pile up, then revert or edit in the responsible version. The sock will be wasting his time."'''  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_voice_phenomenon&diff=prev&oldid=114135299]  While it's possible that there is sock puppetry going on, this seems like a bad way to handle it (particularly if it turned out not to be a sock puppet).  As far as I know, neither editor has taken any action with a sock puppet report or checkuser.  Could an admin look into the situation?  Thanks.  --[[User:Milo H Minderbinder|Milo H Minderbinder]] 21:14, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

Just a quick heads up about this user.  I was shocked a few days ago when a mild joke I made provoked a furious response from this person (including reporting me here for "personal attacks"), so I took a look at his/her past history.  Apparently this person has a history of picking fights on wikipedia:

This user has become quite a problem for several other editors on the board for Shelby Young. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Shelby_Young
He has now flat out called me a racist, TWICE. The issue stems from him PRETENDING to be Greek. You'll note on Ms. Young's talk page, him posting in very plain English, harrassing Ms. Young, then reverting to "comical" broken English, which I find to be racist, seeing as how my father is a German immigrant. The user Leebo has been kept abreast of this, but I've had enough. I'm looking for admin intervention here. This user is wikistalking/wikiharrassing a teenager as well as wikiharrassing me. He contributes nothing of value to Wikipedia. If an admin takes action in this matter, would it be feasible to have someone watch Ms. Young's pages as well as those of Hailey Anne Nelson, specifically for baseless attacks from users coming from the North Carolina area? Thanks in advance. -- [[User:Ispy1981|Ispy1981]] 00:13, 10 March 2007 (UTC)

Anyone see you first post my page should be block you, you have told other people in talk page how you think I am stalker, con artist, you think me a bad editor and you say "How is someone who is greek know so much about Shelby Young."

Not think the internet all america okay?

Any my edit anyone here can see, they can follow all my thing wikipedia and see you follow right behind me. 

You make fun because I am greek, I read only what you write, how can you say pretend greek?

http://www.babelfish.com is what I am useing to follow wikipedia. The comments you make me are very racist and hurtful, I do not know why you jump onto me because I made one edit and now you mad at me.

== Help on [[WP:ANI#Admin_help_needed_on_User_RfC_please]] ==

A few days ago, I sought to open an RfC on [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] after attempts to come to an understanding failed. I was  concerned finding a single neutral editor for a "third opinion" option and opted instead for the RfC to get as many different opinions as possible. I consulted with another editor about how to get one started having little experience myself. The editor I went to also had little experience too, so they in turn went to [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] who didn't seem to believe that two editors had made good faith attempts to address [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] on his talk page. As it turned out, [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] felt the other editor's attempts were insufficient while I had not. Since I was making the RfC in good faith, I assumed the worst that could happen is that it would be rejected. It was not rejected, and the RfC was active as several editors had posted and others had planned to. I don't want to give the impression that I'm unwilling to accept that the RfC was incorrect. The problem I have is that either out of loyalty or perhaps a bruised ego, [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] acted unilaterally  to delete an RfC he disagreed with at the request of the subject of said RfC. I apologize for having to take up more  space here for the same issue. [[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 01:22, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
:I do keep [[User talk:Bishonen]] on my short watchlist. And I saw her (not him, by the way) patiently describe *over* and *over* (to no apparent effect) that user RfCs need to show demonstrated attempts to  come to a resolution, not just any old talk-page arguing -- or, yes, they get deleted. Also clearly explained. Ignoring her clear instructions, you went ahead and the expected, normal thing happened. And now you want to blame Bishonen and make it ''personal''?? (Loyalty? Bruised Ego? See [[WP:NPA]] and Comment on contributions, not personalities, OK?) Get a grip, Anynobody. &mdash;[[User:Bunchofgrapes|Bunchofgrapes]]  ([[User talk:Bunchofgrapes|talk]]) 16:28, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
::Some links might facilitate review for those who don't have my talkpage watchlisted.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen#RFC_minor_formatting] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Bishonen#The_deleted_RfC] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barbara_Schwarz&diff=prev&oldid=114020125] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Anynobody#About_Justanother] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Daniel.Bryant#Thank_you_for_participating] [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] | [[User talk:Bishonen|talk]] 16:56, 11 March 2007 (UTC). (This post has been deleted five times, i think due to some server issue--restoring it again.)

If I understand the situation correctly, when soliciting advice from an administrator one is required to take the advice in question whether it pertains to a POV issue or a procedural one? Procedure requires two editors make a good faith attempt at resolving the issue on the users talk page. If I posted the RfC by myself, I'd understand why disregarding the procedure would get it removed. [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] obviously felt that [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova's]] attempts to address [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] were not in good faith. I believe [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] said something like [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova's]] attempts were nothing more than scolding and dropping warning tags. I have noticed most editors give feedback that way, the subject of the RfC [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] appears to give feedback in this way.  I have difficulty understanding why [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova's]] behavior is considered an example of bad faith when it is so common. (Seriously, the first time I tried to create a username here I got an inappropriate warning and block without the admin telling me what aspect of the proposed username was inappropriate. Another time [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] accused me of violating [[WP:CANVASSING]] by only referencing the tag. I've even caught myself doing it, despite my efforts not to.)
:
Even if I assume that I erred by submitting the RfC, the way it was removed seems unusual. Why would [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] ask a non-involved editor to delete the RfC on this noticeboard, and then delete it herself when none would? If she had just deleted it, I guess it'd be easier to understand. By asking someone else to do it it seemed like she wanted to avoid a COI. Respectfully, [[User:Bunchofgrapes|Bunchofgrapes]] I do have a firm "grip". As I understand it, places like this are the exact place to address concerns about personalities, whereas on the article pages it might be inappropriate. Am I mistaken on that too?

::Please don't take my questions as sour grapes or a smart-ass rhetorical question. I really would appreciate an explanation of my questions. [[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 00:56, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Nobody is saying Smee's warnings etc. weren't ''in good faith''. We are saying they weren't ''dispute resolution''. See the difference?

::I do understand the difference, but based on your comment I must respectfully ask if you know all of the details. I'll briefly summarize:
# [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] wants to delete the article [[Barbara Schwarz]].
# I expressed concern to [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] that he may not be looking at the issue with a neutral POV.
# [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] was unwilling to discuss the possibility, and became a bit hostile. 
# [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova]] attempted to explain to [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] that his response was inappropriate, as well as his hostile attitude, see [[User talk:Justanother/Archive4#Personal_attack_on_User:Anynobody]],[[User talk:Justanother/Archive4#/Personal attacks in edit summaries]], [[User_talk:Justanother/Archive4#Be_nice.]]
# [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] ignored our attempts (mine to address the possibility of a biased POV and [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova's]] attempt to get [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] to temper his attitude in responding (how can anyone resolve a conflict with someone who becomes hostile and is unwilling to discuss issues another editor raises? Either a third opinion or RfC.)
# [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] didn't think there was enough of an attempt made by two users (by suggesting that [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova's]] attempts were insufficient or inappropriate) to set up a RfC... the rest I think everyone knows.
::I honestly think that these discussions are "dispute resolution", ([[User talk:Justanother/Archive4#Personal_attack_on_User:Anynobody]],[[User_talk:Justanother/Archive4#/Personal attacks in edit summaries]], [[User_talk:Justanother/Archive4#Be_nice.]]) since [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] deemed it to not be "dispute resolution" it seemed like she was saying [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova]] was acting in "bad faith" based on her description of [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova's]] efforts. (If [[User:Smeelgova|Smeelgova]] wasn't trying to resolve anything by addressing [[User:Justanother|Justanother's]] behavior, wouldn't that be acting in bad faith?)
::I understand that [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] and some others may see it as a poorly executed attempt at dispute resolution, but it's important to note that the requirements do not say "Two WELL EXECUTED attempts at dispute resolution", merely that two attempts must be made.
:: I'd honestly like to know how to deal with an editor who not only spends a majority of his time editing articles related to his religion but trying to remove information which could any way be interpreted as negative to said religion, even though it may be appropriate. Further, the editor refuses to discuss concerns of a possible conflict in his goals and those of Wikipedia. (I'm not interested in editing Scientology articles on a regular basis, and personally don't care about the CoS any more than I do other religions, if anyone thinks I have a COI I'm happy t discuss it. [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] will not even discuss his negative  attitude let alone a possible COI). I'm not saying I am correct, that's why I wanted a RfC because I assume if I was incorrect that would have come out with the resolution of the RfC.
:: Which goes toward what [[User:Bunchofgrapes|Bunchofgrapes]] was saying about bad RfCs. I would never advocate a bad request get through just because others have. I just expected if it was a bad request an uninvolved administrator would say so. By [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] deleting it and essentially saying "I told you not to because not enough of an attempt was made to resolve the dispute" without suggesting how to make attempts or pointing out previous RfCs with attempts [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]] thought were more worthy, I'm back where I started without a real explanation (by real I mean details about WHY the attempts don't work for [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]]. I honestly don't mean to disrespect [[User:Bishonen|Bishonen]], but saying the arguments are "no good" leaves the reason open to interpretation.

== Vote fraud on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Arnon Katz‎]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kinnernet‎]] ==   
Looks like [[user:Israelbeach]] aka Joel Leyden is enlisting sockpuppets and or meatpuppets again to protect his favored articles from deletion. See also his own website: [www.israelnewsagency.com/kinnernetinternetwikipediabarhillelwoolwalescensorship47030807.html], [www.israelnewsagency.com/internetkinnernetyossivardiisraelhitechconference4888030707.html], [www.israelnewsagency.com/kinnernetinternetisraelconferencevarditechvardi4877030607.html] (complete with gratuitous mentions of Brittney Spears and Madonna.)   
I don't think there's any point in conducting checkusers, as he obviously has access to several IPs, and I think he sometimes enlists friends to post on his behalf. But the behaviour is classic sock/meatpuppetry, as evidenced in the contributions. And it's a pattern that repeats over and over. I've taken a lot of personal heat just for standing up to this user, so I'd appreciate another, possibly more impartial administrator getting involved, or at least expressing an opinion here. He's already under a community ban - is there any reason not to go ahead and block all the suspected sockpuppets?

Virgil Vaduza aka (I suspect) Frank Thomas is  behaving in a bizzare and frightening fashion in the Brian McLaren article. 

1) Virgil will not allow me (Will3935) to contribute any edits of substance (only punctuation corrections). The contributions I have offered have been well supported by citations, yet they are promptly reverted in every case.

2)Virgil has been escalating hostilities while I have been trying to salvage a working relationship and make friends (user pages and discussion page will confirm this). His tone is exceedingly harsh and belittling, and he cannot be pacified. His many comments in the discussion page and the userpages have all contained personal attacks which are only getting worse.

3)After intense dialog with Virgil Vaduza along with mild intervention from Vassanya (admin), Virgil temporarily left the scene in favor of "Frank Thomas" an editor with no userpage who had not, to my knowledge, contributed to the article before this. Frank only had made a few previous edits in his Wikipedia career (most in subjects Virgil is interested in). Frank exhibited the same level of hostility and acrimony that Virgil had and echoed Virgil's arguments verbatim. Now Virgil has reappeared and the two act in perfect tandem, offering insults and attacks within minutes of each other. The intense level and frequncy of the attacks by far surpasses anything I have seen in my over 1200 edits in Wikipedia. Frank and Virgil's attacks seem to be clones of each other in tone, content, and severity. They have come in machine gun rapidity and in tandem. I believe my sockpuppetry suspicion is not unwarranted.

4)Virgil / Frank has repeatedly tried to bait me into revealing my true identity. I find this, along with the tone in which it is done, to be quite frightening. It seems to me that Virgil / Frank wants to take this conflict outside of Wikipedia. I have a personal life and a family to protect.

5)Though I did try to mix it up with Virgil at first, I have sinced repented and apologized. I have made many, many friendly overtures (the edit history on the discussion page and our userpages will show this to be quite true). Nevertheless, Virgil / Frank keeps escalating things to bizarre and frightening extremes.

6)Previous editors have apparently been scared away by Virgil's strong-handed tactics.

7)We desparately need intervention in the Brian McLaren article and any help will be appreciated.

== Admin help needed on [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (4th nomination)]] please ==

Hi. I can use a bit of admin help over at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barbara Schwarz (4th nomination)]], please. [[User:Anynobody]] is injecting an extensive counterpoint into the middle of my signed comment that I opened the AfD with, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBarbara_Schwarz_%284th_nomination%29&diff=114422442&oldid=114421276 diff]. I originally moved his counterpoint to what I felt was a proper, and prominent, position at the end of the current discussion, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBarbara_Schwarz_%284th_nomination%29&diff=114432301&oldid=114422442 diff]. Anynobody continues to edit war with me over placing the counterpoint in the midst of my comment, which, IMO, detracts from my continuity to the detriment of my comment, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Barbara_Schwarz_%284th_nomination%29&action=history history]. I am pretty sure that sure Anynobody's placement is inappropriate but I would appreciate some help and input on a proper resolution. I did ask Anynoboy to self-revert and discuss on talk, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBarbara_Schwarz_%284th_nomination%29&diff=114458968&oldid=114458240 here], but he did not respond to that request. Thank you very much! --[[User:Justanother|Justanother]] 04:03, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
:It should be noted that [[User:Stebbins]] commented thusly:  ''This was the longest AfD comment I had ever read... until I read the archived discussions from the first 3 AfDs. With all due respect to you argument, Justanother, might I advise that you try to be a bit more concise in future AfDs. Also, you don't need to vote on your own AfD (although I would recommend signing your comments).'' - With such a long comment from the nominating editor, it does seem appropriate to have a counter point directly below the nom's comments, or better yet have an Admin step in and drastically shorten the nom's commentary.  [[User:Smeelgova|Smee]] 04:08, 12 March 2007 (UTC).
:I would like to ask a related question: Is there a maximum size for nomination text in an AfD? This issue may not have ever come up before but it seems to me that there may be concerns about a nominator starting an AfD with an entire screen's worth of text, in no less than four separate sections, and accusing of "[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FBarbara_Schwarz_%284th_nomination%29&diff=114458968&oldid=114458240 rude and inappropriate action]" anyone who tries to respond to ''one'' of those sections before the nominator has said everything he wants to say in ''all'' his sections. It seems to me that dominating an AfD in that manner may itself be the "rude and inappropriate action". -- [[User:Antaeus Feldspar|Antaeus Feldspar]] 04:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC) (To place this in perspective -- my word processor says that Justanother's nomination text is 1063 words.

Thanks. --[[User:Justanother|Justanother]] 05:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

[[User:Anynobody|Anynobody]] 06:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC) 

*Just for chuckles, we should keep in mind that, when writing an academic paper or business presentation, the rule is 250 words is a page.  Therefore, the nomination was 20 pages.  It's probably best, if you're going past a "page," to put your arguments on a page in your user space and then say, "See ''pagename'' for arguments."  Otherwise, the long slog that is AfD becomes endless.  [[User:Geogre|Geogre]] 10:26, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
::Good point for the future, [[User:Geogre|Geogre]]. I don't know if the comment I added falls into the nomination. Whether it does or not if [[User:Justanother|Justanother]] follows your advice on this AfD, I'll do the same.

== [[User:Virgil Vaduva]] ==

This is a <i>seemingly</i> blatant meatpuppet/sockpuppet case. I'm a bit loathe to wade in the middle, as I have been acting as a neutral party, but it <i>appears</i> to be a fairly obvious case. I am not taking a position as to whether this is a meatpuppet or sockpuppet case, as Wikipedia guildelines explicitly treat them equally.

{{user|Virgil Vaduva}} has been very active on [[Brian McLaren]]/[[Talk:Brian McLaren]]. {{user|Frank Thomas}} has very recently joined in the fray. I provided a [[WP:3O|third opinion]] at the posted request of {{user|Will3935}}. I have been intervening since as a fellow editor/informal mediator, trying to cool things down. I have repeatedly asked that they take a breath and focus on the article. Just explaining how I got involved, now to the crux of the matter. 

Frank's contributions are very suspcious. Warning flag #1, checking [[Special:Contributions/Frank_Thomas|his contributions]], you can see his 5th-8th edits show an intimate understanding of Wikipedia that are unusual for a new user.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Preterism&diff=prev&oldid=98431613]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Preterism&diff=prev&oldid=98959377] Such an early familiarity with Wikipedia rules is one of the primary warning flags for meat/sock-puppetry.

This is just what I have noticed about the <i>strong appearance</i> of sockpuppet/meatpuppet involvement in this dispute. The atmosphere at [[Brian McLaren]] is already downright poisonous and if meatpuppets/sockpuppets are involved, that's just far too much to tolerate.

::There seems to be some confusion on that. I have been told in the past that RFCU is not the appropriate place to start, but rather where to go when the case is unclear, in relation to another existing case brought before the administrators. Also, it has been made clear to me that RFCU only verifies ''sockpuppets'', but that ''meatpuppets'' are an equal violation which usually cannot be verified by RFCU. The RFCU page itself states: <i>Checkuser is a last resort for difficult cases.</i> So it seemed appropriate to raise the issue elsewhere first, particularly given the apparently obvious nature of this case. [[User:Vassyana|Vassyana]] 07:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Just some thoughts from someone who has dealt with (way too many) sockpuppet cases. First of all, Vassyana, you are correct about CU. They want you to explore other avenues first. In fact, they will reject cases based on it being obvious that someone is a sockpuppet. They will just say "too obvious. Block" or something to that effect. Secondly, it does look like a pretty strong possibility that this is a sock/meatpuppet. What stands out to me is the gap between edits and the single minded nature of Frank Thomas. Yes, there are users who edit one article much more than others, but it's usually not that exclusive. And it's quite odd for someone to come back after 2 months and hit an article that hard. On the other hand, I do see that Frank and Virgil are editing around the same time. I.e. you do not have Frank editing from say 7 pm to 9 pm and then Virgil taking over. There is some overlap. This suggests a meatpuppet, though I've seen cases ([[User:HeadleyDown]] being a prominent example) of people switching off between sockpuppets in a debate. But it's more likely to be a friend of Virgil. I am going to go ahead and block Frank's account indefinitely. It looks pretty clear cut to me. I'll also label his account as a sockpuppet of Virgil. It is obviously a meatpuppet or sockpuppet. As for Virgil, I think for now I'm going to warn him about sock/meatpuppet use. I don't see any warnings for sockpuppet use on his page. It's always best to warn first. If he uses another sockpuppet, let the board or me personally know and we'll go from there. --[[User:Woohookitty|''Woohookitty'']]<sup>[[User talk:Woohookitty|Woohoo!]]</sup> 11:43, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

Greetings all, I want to file a counter complaint with the administration here against user [[User:Will3935]]. I have been a Wikipedia contributor for years now and I have contributed quality content to many articles as my busy schedule permits.  I have never met such a threatening and arrogant user as Will3935 until now.  He has flaunted his "credentials" with his very first entry in order to override opposing POV and despite his non-admin status he has threatened me with "blocking" when I disagreed with him.  When another user challenged his flaunting of credentials he became even more irate, suggesting that he is being "attacked" when one person simply asked to identify himself. He clearly has no authority to "block" users yet he is implying this to end-users and threatening them with those actions in order to get an upper-hand in pushing a certain POV.  Whenever I pointed out his ad-hominem attacks and language he always reverts to his "diabetes" problem!

Only once he has made numerous and substantial changes to [[Brian McLaren]] did he seek to collaborate with other contributors. Once I disagreed again with his "shotgun" approach he became irate and brought in numerous personal attacks, of which I quote below, some of which are of extremely personal nature, such as my health.

* "Frankly, I'm a little concerned about your health" (what the hell do you know about my health?)
* "makes me suspect you are a young man" (wikipedia is age-discriminating now?)
* "It's either Virgil's way or he goes and complains to admins" (I have never complained until just now)
* "it just shows how poorly read Virgil is" (pure ad-hominem attack)
* "Your ignorance should not limit the scope of this article" (another ad-hominem attack)
* "act more mature and quit picking fights" (implying another user is not mature)
* "if you feel a tantrum coming on just try to act normal" (implying another user is not normal)

Frankly I only expect fairness from you folks so the entire history of his attacks and interaction is in [[Talk:Brian_McLaren]]. You can read for yourself how this user has inflamed the situation and how he is now manufacturing attacks against himself in order to promote whatever agenda he has. 

I am using my real name here, unlike him I am not hiding behind an IP address or a wall of anonymity. I never broke any Wikipedia rules, and I am simply asking that someone would intervene and stop an out-of-control maniacal user who apparently thinks no rules apply to him because he claims to have "credentials" that exempt him from participating in the collaboration process.

== New Zealand Crown Copyright ==

There's been quite a bit of talk at [[Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion/2007 March 7]] (see primarily Image:Ct4e.jpg section) and [[Wikipedia talk:Copyright problems]] (see New Zealand Crown Copyright section). I nominated a few New Zealand Crown Copyright images for deletion, as Crown Copyright has long been recognized as too restrictive, and no claim of fair use had been made. No fair use claim ''could'' be made, either, for a few of these images, as there are free alternatives already available on Wikipedia.

Quite a few users, however, are arguing that we ''overlook'' the "ideological" restrictions, or that we start a new category of images with "[l]icenses that aren't free, but won't be subjected to either the fair use rationale test or the replaceability test." There's not really a grey area for this &mdash; either images are free, which we'll allow, or they aren't, for which we'll argue fair use (though there's not much of an argument for a lot of these images) or delete. Anyone with a bit more "credibility" than me have a better way of explaining this to them?

== Stalking, Harassment and personal attacks from [[User:Dahn]] ==

<div class="boilerplate metadata" style="background-color: #C7BEFA; margin: 2em 0 0 0; padding: 0 10px 0 10px; border: 1px solid #8779DD;">

No further edits should be made to this page.'' <!-- from Template:Archive top-->
I am reporting [[User:Dahn]] for his abuse, stalking, harassment and personal attacks on [[User:Icar]] and others. He has a pattern of disruptive behavior that appears to a reasonable and objective observer to have the purpose of causing negative emotions in the targeted person ([[User:Icar]]) and others for the purpose of intimidating him/them. [[User:Dahn]] has been a trouble maker for some time now pushing his POV on wikipedia (e.g. his last edits), numerous accounts of misbehavior, vandalism, trolling. It seems that there are a group of editors with the backing of a couple of administrators who are working together in regards to POV pushing using Wikipedia as their own POV propaganda tool. One of them is also [[User:Dahn]]. Some people say that Dahn is a reliable contributor, and I ask you “is this model of reliable contributor?” Some other say that he’s a regular edit warrior. 
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam_in_Romania&diff=111733632&oldid=111733285 here] and also [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alexandru_Nicolschi&diff=113854347&oldid=113850197] are just 2 examples. To conclude, [[User:Icar]] was blocked for saying "vandal" to Dahn, but Dahn was never blocked for the same calling. I ask Admins to say their opinion.  <font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">HIZKIAH</font> <small>([[User:HIZKIAH|User]]&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;[[User_talk:HIZKIAH|Talk]])</small> 15:14, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:I can only hope that administrators will understand why deleting valid and sourced information is vandalism, and why tweaking a lead to make it look like a Romanian citizen was not a Romanian citizen is POV-pushing. I am not responsible for whomever else got blocked. I ''strongly object'' to the notion that I was engaged in harassment: I have significantly contributed to ''all'' those articles (some of them I have virtually authored), and it is I who is being followed around with POV-pushes. As for the reliable contributor issue, let others see what I have significantly contributed to, and how much reliable and sourced-based text I added to wikipedia. That is all I have to say. [[User:Dahn|Dahn]] 16:25, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

::I think this is a similar case as [[Alexandru Nicolschi]] article where [[User:Dahn]] wants to hide that that person had '''dual''' citizenship and had a clear foreign allegiance (that person declared himself which one was his true country, however that's not enough for Dahn to be worth mentioning). By pushing his POV he accuses other people of POV pushing, he constantly does that by nasty behavior, calling people vandals or not smart enough to understand his posts (by allusions and insinuations) and by basically bulling everybody into accepting his POV. He also doesn't wait for other opinions (on my repeated calls for that) which basically works against consensus building of Wikipedia. I was accused of many things by [[User:Dahn]] only because I changed 2-3 minor things to make the 2 articles more accurate. If you want to witness his modus operandi take a look and his discussion with me on [[Talk:Alexandru_Nicolschi#My_2_cents]] and [[Talk:Securitate#Rom.C3.A2nul_Boris_Gr.C3.BCnberg.3F]] and see for yourselves how he bullies people around by accusing them of things they didn't say and assuming unintended meanings of words only to start wars. In one occasion he even drove me to be plain uncivil -- this is something that he does very well, he bullies people around till they snap... My guess is that's exactly what happened with [[User:Icar]]. -- [[User:AdrianTM|AdrianTM]] 17:13, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
:::In case someone is interested in this, my comments have been given in full on the talk page, where I have presented basic and reliable proof of why the AdrianTM's edit is POV pushing. Wikipedia's goal is reliable source-backed information, not consensus over how to manipulate facts. [[User:Dahn|Dahn]] 17:37, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:Yes, but constantly having a nasty behavior, calling people vandals (by allusions and insinuations) it's really a bad thing! While it feels bad to be attacked by one of the persistent, nasty, obsessive trolls, it is helpful to remember that some of these people are profoundly miserable. They are really suffering; life is hell for them: often they are neither in control of their impulses, nor completely sane. A little compassion can help, although one's initial impulse is to strike back. Don't. It's a sign of strength not to retaliate, and a peaceful response may actually do some good. Try to be as tolerant as you possibly can regarding edits by established contributors. Should you need to revert one, leave as polite an explanation as possible, with room for compromise: and if they're simply wrong, don't rub their nose in it. The risk of losing long-established contributors due to avoidable conflict is one of the greatest the project faces. People who have been here a year or more, and made thousands of contributions to the project, are its greatest asset, and this cannot be overstated. The consequences of reverting a good-faith edit with a vandalism-reversion tool or "rvv" edit summary are unpredictable, and unlikely to win you friends or trust. As a general rule, do not edit when you are angry. Wait until the feeling has passed, and you are yourself again.

=== POV parole===
Dahn should be placed on POV parole for up to and including one year. If he re-inserts any edits which are judged by a majority of those commenting on the relevant talk page in a 24-hour poll to be a violation of the NPOV policy, then he shall be temp-banned for a short time, up to one week. Repeat deletions of text, similarly judged to result in a violation of NPOV, shall be treated in the same way. --<font style="font-family:Monotype Corsiva; font-size:15px;">HIZKIAH</font> <small>([[User:HIZKIAH|User]]&nbsp;&#149;&nbsp;[[User_talk:HIZKIAH|Talk]])</small> 18:31, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

===attacks on editors from [[User:Dahn]]===

The attacks on editors take the form of accusing the editors of being vandals, e.g. on [[User:Icar]] in an attempt to poison the well in terms of those editors' reputations. He engages in seemingly endless arguments on the Talk pages, so that most editors eventually get worn down and give up http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Romanian_Wikipedians%27_notice_board#Section_for_Dahn.27s_rant_over_other_editors_who_try_to_understand_what_happened_with_the_User:KhoiKhoi_account_on_ro.wiki.

== Indef blocked User:Pogsurf sockpuppetry ==

Hi, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&type=block&page=User:Pogsurf indef blocked] [[User:Pogsurf]] (vandalism only account) is evading their block with a sockpuppet, [[User:Lobster blogster]]. Both users demonstrated a high level of Wikipedia skill immediately after registration, and have demonstrated the same MO by editing a very narrow range of articles (especially [[Paul Staines]] and [[Claire Ward]], who is the current MP for Watford, a page Lobster blogster has also edited) and repeatedly linking to the same ''Guardian'' article. Also, a quick google confirms the link between "Pogsurf", "Lobster blogster", and Watford, however I won't post the links as it's poor wikiquette to reveal peoples' real names online unless they volunteer them. I raised this first on [[User:Majorly]]'s [[User talk:Majorly#Paul Staines|talk page]], but moving it here to go through the official channels. Could an admin deal please? Cheers, [[User:DWaterson|DWaterson]] 16:03, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

:Just to add more proof, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Paul_Staines&action=history], [[User:62.136.198.105]] appears to be the same as [[User:Lobster blogster]]. [[User:Pogsurf]] had an anonymous alter ego, which was [[User:62.136.238.65]]. A quick comparison of their edit histories shows this, and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:62.136.238.65&diff=109272579&oldid=109195908] shows Pogsurf thanking another user for a comment left on 62.136.238.65's talk page - something he'd only do if they are the same. Note that 62.136.198.105 and 62.136.238.65 are the same ISP, and both perform the same kind of edits. This shows that 62.136.238.65, 62.136.238.65, Pogsurf and Lobster Blogster are one and the same. Note as well that Lobster Blogster has also edited the Watford talk page, with a very similar comment to one Pogsurf left on articles before he was banned. And Pogsurf was often editing  Claire Ward - who is the MP for Watford. [[User:Nssdfdsfds|Nssdfdsfds]] 16:51, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

I have just added this back from the archives, as the user is still here, should still be blocked, and is still inserting libellous material into [[Talk:Paul Staines]]. Could *someone* please block him - this process doesn't seem to be working.

I have restored this incident report again, as nothing has been done the previous two times. The user has admitted to being a sock of the blocked vandal, saying [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Paul_Staines&diff=114540587&oldid=113468931] "Just a small point to add here, that it was Nssdfdsfds that repeatedly undid revisions of mine both here on the discussion page, and on the article itself." The article has been protected since February 19, but Lobster Blogster's account was created on 3rd March - he's clearly referring to his previous vandalism as the permabanned user Pogsurf. [[User:Nssdfdsfds|Nssdfdsfds]] 22:24, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

:Sorry to see Nssdfdsfds getting in a tizzy and telling tales out of school here. It's perfectly true that after Pogsurf was blocked by Persian Poet Gal as a "Vandal Only Account" I created the "Lobster Bloster" account. However I object strongly to the label "Vandal Only Account" which I assume is being used perjoratively, and not as an obscure reference to my Germanic ancestry. If Nssdfdsfds bothered to discuss prospective changes via talk pages I don't think so much hot air and wind would be generated. Please feel free to ban me again if you feel that is the right thing to do.
