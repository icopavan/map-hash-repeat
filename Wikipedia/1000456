'''Eddie Adams''' (June 12, 1933 – September 19, 2004) was a [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[photographer]] and [[photojournalist]] noted for portraits of celebrities and politicians and his coverage of 13 wars.

==Combat photographer==
Adams served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] during the [[Korean War]] as a [[War photography|combat photographer]].  One of his assignments was to photograph the entire [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Demilitarized Zone]] from end to end immediately following the war. This took him over a month to complete.

==Pulitzer Prize winning photograph==
[[File:Nguyen.jpg|thumb|200px|Adams' photograph of Nguyễn Ngọc Loan executing Nguyễn Văn Lém on February 1, 1968]]
It was while covering the [[Vietnam War]] for the [[Associated Press]] that he took his best-known photograph &ndash; the picture of police chief General [[Nguyễn Ngọc Loan]] executing a [[Vietcong]] prisoner, [[Nguyễn Văn Lém]], on a [[Saigon]] street, on February 1, 1968, during the opening stages of the [[Tet Offensive]]. 

Adams won the 1969 [[Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography]] and a [[World Press Photo]] award for the photograph (captioned 'General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner in Saigon'), but would later lament its notoriety<ref>{{cite news| url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/the-pulitzer-eddie-adams-didnt-want/ | work=The New York Times | first=Donald R. | last=Winslow | title=The Pulitzer Eddie Adams Didn't Want | date=April 19, 2011}}</ref>. Writer and critic [[David D. Perlmutter]] points out that 'no film footage did as much damage as [[Associated Press|AP]] photographer Eddie Adams's [[35mm]] shot taken on a [[Saigon]] street ... When people talk or write about [the [[Tet Offensive]]] at least a sentence is devoted (often with an illustration) to the Eddie Adams picture'.<ref>1999: 205-207</ref> 

Anticipating the impact of Adams's photograph, an attempt at balance was sought by editors in the [[New York Times]]. In his memoirs,<ref>Get the Picture; A Personal History of Photojournalism, p. 241</ref> John G. Morris recalls that;
([[Theodore M. Bernstein]]), "determined that the brutality manifested by America's ally be put into perspective, agreed to run the Adams picture large, but offset with a picture of a child slain by [[Vietcong]], which conveniently came through from [[Associated Press|AP]] at about the same time".
Nonetheless, it is Adams's photograph that is remembered while the other far less dramatic image was overlooked and soon forgotten. 

In [[Regarding the Pain of Others]], [[Susan Sontag]] is disturbed by what she sees as the staged nature of the photograph. She writes that 'he would not have carried out the summary execution there had [the press] not been available to witness it'.<ref>Sontag, 2002: 53</ref> However, Donald Winslow of the [[New York Times]] quotes Adams as having described the image as a 'reflex picture' and 'wasn't certain of what he'd photographed until the film was developed'. Furthermore, Winslow notes that Adams 'wanted me to understand that “Saigon Execution” was not his most important picture and that he did not want his obituary to begin, “Eddie Adams, the photographer best known for his iconic Vietnam photograph ‘Saigon Execution’'  <ref>{{cite news| url=http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/19/the-pulitzer-eddie-adams-didnt-want/ | work=The New York Times | first=Donald R. | last=Winslow | title=The Pulitzer Eddie Adams Didn't Want | date=April 19, 2011}}</ref>.

On Nguyen Ngoc Loan and his famous photograph, Adams wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'':
{{cquote|The general killed the Viet Cong; I killed the general with my camera. Still photographs are the most powerful weapon in the world.  People believe them; but photographs do lie, even without manipulation. They are only half-truths. ... What the photograph didn't say was, 'What would you do if you were the general at that time and place on that hot day, and you caught the so-called bad guy after he blew away one, two or three American people?'<ref>[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=M2QxNWY0N2ZkY2IxMWJhZGQ4MTU3ZjhlZjg3NTk0NzE= There Are Tears in My Eyes - Eddie Adams & the Most Famous Photo of the Vietnam War, by Jonah Goldberg 1999]</ref>}}

Adams later apologized in person to General Nguyen and his family for the irreparable damage it did to the General's honor while he was alive. When Nguyen died, Adams praised him as a "hero" of a "just cause".<ref>[http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs024/imagesHistoric.html#06.jpg Image Canon - Historic Images]</ref> On the television show "[[War Stories with Oliver North]]" Adams called Gen. Nguyen "a goddamned hero!"{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

He once said, "I would have rather been known more for the series of photographs I shot of 48 Vietnamese refugees who managed to sail to [[Thailand]] in a 30-foot boat, only to be towed back to the open seas by Thai marines." The photographs, and accompanying reports, helped persuade then President [[Jimmy Carter]] to grant the nearly 200,000 Vietnamese [[boat people]] [[refugee|asylum]]. He won the [[Robert Capa Gold Medal]] from the [[Overseas Press Club]] in 1977 for this series of photographs in his photo essay, "The Boat of No Smiles"  (Published by [[Associated Press|AP]]).<ref>[http://www.opcofamerica.org/opc_awards/archive/byaward/award_capa.php The OPC's Robert Capa Gold Medal]</ref> Adams remarked, "It did some good and nobody got hurt."<ref>{{cite web |last = Eddie Adams|title = Interview for PBS|url=http://www.pbs.org/speaktruthtopower/hr_eddie.htm|accessdate = 2007-06-01 }}</ref>

==Awards==
Along with the Pulitzer, Adams received over 500 awards, including the [[George Polk Award]] for News Photography in 1968, 1977 and 1978, and numerous awards from World Press Photo, NPPA, Sigma Delta Chi, Overseas Press Club, and many other organizations.  

Adams died in [[New York City]] from complications of [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Adams's legacy is continued through Barnstorm: The Eddie Adams Workshop, the photography workshop he started in 1988.

He is the subject of a 2009 [[Documentary film|documentary]] feature, ''An Unlikely Weapon'', directed by Susan Morgan Cooper and narrated by [[Kiefer Sutherland]].<ref>[http://www.anunlikelyweapon.com/ ''An Unlikely Weapon''] (official site)</ref>

==Eddie Adams Photographic Archive==
The photographic archive of Eddie Adams has been donated by his widow, Alyssa Adams, to the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at [[The University of Texas at Austin]]. The archive documents Adams's career and includes "Saigon Execution," his Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph. Measuring 200 linear feet in size, the Eddie Adams Photographic Archive includes slides, negatives, prints, audio and video materials, news stories, diaries, notes and tear sheets. In addition to substantive coverage of the Vietnam War, the collection includes his in-depth features on poverty in America, the homeless, [[Mother Teresa]], [[Brazil]], alternative society, anti-war demonstrations, and riots, as well as his intimate portraits of such high-profile figures as [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Jerry Lewis]].

==Auction records==
On October 22, 2009 [[Swann Galleries]] auctioned a special print of Adams's most well-known image, ''Saigon (General Nguyen Ngoc Loan executing a Viet Cong prisoner Nguyen Van Lém)''. The oversize silver print image—printed in the 1980s—had been a gift to Adams’s son and came with letter of provenance. The back of the photograph was signed and had Adams's notation, "Saigon, 1968." It sold for $43,200.
