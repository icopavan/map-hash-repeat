{{nihongo|'''Kefka Palazzo'''|ケフカ・パラッツォ|Kefuka Parattso|spelled '''Cefca Palazzo''' in Japanese materials}} is a character in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series of video games. Originally designed by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], he appears in ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' as a [[clown]]-like, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] [[psychopathy|psychopath]] who acts as the game's main antagonist. He also appears in the spinoff [[fighting game]]s ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'', wherein he is voiced by [[Shigeru Chiba]] in Japanese and [[Dave Wittenberg]] in English.

==Conception and design==
Kefka's appearance was designed by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], who was given complete creative control over ''Final Fantasy VI'' with the brief character outlines he was handed, designing them to feel "alive" within his imagination though with consideration for the representation as small computer [[sprite (graphics)|sprites]].<ref>{{cite book |editor= |title=Japan: Final Fantasy |accessdate=June 7, 2010 |date=August 11, 1994 |publisher=[[NTT Publishing]] |language=Japanese |isbn=4871883388 |chapter=Interview  |pages=108–109}}</ref> Given only the artwork and outline to work with during production, writer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] felt that one early scene of the character approaching a castle was too "boring to make completely normal", and decided to [[ad-lib]] a scene with one of his accompanying soldiers dusting off his boots in the middle of a desert. The scene set the tone for Kefka's personality from that point onwards as a result, suggesting there "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=9002538&publicUserId=6049935 |title=The Making of Dissidia Final Fantasy - Final Words from the Producer |author=Kitase, Yoshinori |authorlink=Yoshinori Kitase |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=2009-10-21 |date=2009-08-27}}</ref>

== Appearances ==
=== Final Fantasy VI ===
Kefka first appears as a general under the game's primary antagonist [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Emperor Gestahl|Emperor Gestahl]]. Prior to the start of the game, he was the first human to be experimentally infused with the [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Magic|magic]]-like craft "Magitek," which granted him the ability to wield magic, although the imperfect process warped his mind and made him into the [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] [[psychopath]] he is during the course of the game.<ref>'''Vector citizen:''' Here's one for you... That guy Kefka? He was Cid's first experimental Magitek knight. But the process wasn't perfect yet. Something snapped in Kefka that day... [[Square Co., Ltd.]] ''Final Fantasy VI'' (in [[English language|English]]) 1994-10-11 ([[North America|NA]])</ref> Kefka mentally enslaves [[Terra Branford|Terra]] and uses her to lead an attack on the town of Narshe to claim the frozen [[esper]] there. When she escapes Imperial control, he pursues Terra to the kingdom of Figaro, setting the castle ablaze as she, [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Locke|Locke]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Edgar|King Edgar]] flee.

During a siege on the kingdom of Doma, Kefka grows impatient with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire. To gain the trust of the protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there,<ref>'''Leo:'''  Kefka! What do you think you're doing!? / '''Kefka:''' Hee-hee-hee... Emperor's orders! I'm to turn all these Espers into magicite. Behold! A magicite mother lode! [[Square Co., Ltd.]] ''Final Fantasy VI'' (in [[English language|English]]) 1994-10-11 ([[North America|NA]])</ref> killing Leo when he tries to intervene. Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers' homeworld and create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as the Warring Triad. Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Celes|Celes]], whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. She instead stabs Kefka, who becomes enraged. Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad - the Emperor taking a more conservative approach, since he only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash the Warring Triad's full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having the Warring Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death. Kefka then moves the statues of the Warring Triad out of balance, unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game.<ref>'''Celes:''' Oh, that's really smart, Kefka! Disturb their delicate balance, and they'll go haywire...! [[Square Co., Ltd.]] ''Final Fantasy VI'' (in [[English language|English]]) 1994-10-11 ([[North America|NA]])</ref>

Imbued with the power of the statues, Kefka becomes the god of the ruined world he created, using the statues to forge a massive tower of random debris to serve as his headquarters. Kefka smites the millions who refuse to worship him with his "Light of Judgment", a beam of incinerating light capable of cutting fissures into the planet's surface. Confronted by the protagonists at the game's conclusion, Kefka reveals his nihilistic motivations. When the protagonists reject his claims, Kefka goes berserk and proclaims his desire to eradicate everything.<ref>'''Kefka:''' I've tapped into the ultimate power. Observe...! / ... / '''Kefka:''' This is sickening... You sound like chapters from a self-help booklet! Prepare yourselves! [[Square Co., Ltd.]] ''Final Fantasy VI'' (in [[English language|English]]) 1994-10-11 ([[North America|NA]])</ref><ref>'''Kefka:''' I will destroy everything... I will create a monument to non-existence! / '''Unidentified party member:''' Life will go on! There will always be people, and dreams! / '''Kefka:''' No! I will hunt them down. I will destroy it all! Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!! [[Square Co., Ltd.]] ''Final Fantasy VI'' (in [[English language|English]]) 1994-10-11 ([[North America|NA]])</ref> He reveals his godlike form and attacks the protagonists before he is ultimately dispatched, causing the power of magic to vanish.

=== Other appearances ===
Kefka is the villain representing ''Final Fantasy VI'' in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', opposing Terra Branford and reflecting his mannerisms from the game. During Destiny Odyssey, Kefka allies himself with the Cloud of Darkness to bring Terra to their side because of her Esper powers, hoping to use the girl for his own scheme to destroy everything. However, when Terra refuses to aid him and learned to control her powers, Kefka attempts to kill her and ends up being defeated with Terra gaining her crystal. During Shade Impulse, after mocking the heroes as they almost faded, Kefka breaks his ties to the other villains and starts his own scheme to become the ruler of the ruined world before being ultimately dispatched for good. Along the entire cast, Kefka appears in the prequel ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name="Pre-TGS Flying Get">{{cite web| url=http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2010/09/15/flying_get/ |title=This Week's Pre-TGS Flying Get |publisher=Andriasang|author=Gantayat, Anoop  |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}</ref> Holding control over Terra's mind, Kefka uses her to fight until [[Characters_of_Final_Fantasy_IX#Kuja|Kuja]] weakens his spell, allowing Terra to resist him. [[Vaan]] finds Kefka torturing her and helps Terra escape, Kefka's spell eventually breaking as they leave him behind. Kefka later confronts the heroes with other Warriors of Chaos to stop them from closing the portal the Manikins are emerging from, but is defeated by Vaan.

He also makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Itadaki Street Portable]]''.

[[Konami]] video game developer Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka did not have shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that turned him into a sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't "evil for evil's sake." There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you could feel it... but you also knew there wasn't any good in there."<ref>Hulett, Tom (2006-10-09).
