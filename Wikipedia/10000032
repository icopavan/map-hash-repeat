'''Mid Antrim''' was a constituency of the [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]].

The ''House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland), 1929'' introduced [[first past the post|first-past-the-post]] elections for 48 single-member constituencies (including ''Antrim Mid'').

It was a single-member division of [[County Antrim]] represented in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]]. Before 1929, it was part of the seven-member [[Antrim (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Antrim]] constituency. The constituency sent one MP to the [[House of Commons of Northern Ireland]] from 1929 until the Parliament was [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972|temporarily suspended]] in 1972, and then [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973|formally abolished]] in 1973.

In terms of the then local government areas the constituency in 1929 comprised parts of the [[Rural District|rural districts]] of [[Ballymena]], [[Ballymoney]] and [[Larne]]. The division also included the whole of the [[urban district]] of [[Ballymena]].
