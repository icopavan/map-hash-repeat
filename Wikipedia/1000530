The '''Nagorno-Karabakh Republic''' ('''NKR''')<ref name="Constitution"/> ({{lang-hy|Լեռնային Ղարաբաղի Հանրապետություն}} ''Lernayin Gharabaghi Hanrapetut’yun''), or '''Artsakh Republic''' ({{lang-hy|Արցախի Հանրապետություն}} ''Arts'akhi Hanrapetut’yun'')<ref name="Constitution">{{cite web|url=http://www.nkr.am/en/constitution/9/|title=Constitution of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Chapter 1, article 1.2}}</ref> is a ''de facto'' [[independence|independent]] republic located in the [[South Caucasus]] region of [[Eurasia]]. It controls most of the territory of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] and several [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno Karabakh|Azerbaijani districts]] adjacent to the borders of Azerbaijan with [[Armenia]] to the west and [[Iran]] to the south.<ref>[http://www.president.nkr.am/en/nkr/generalInformation/ Official website of the President of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic. General Information about NKR]</ref>

The predominantly [[Armenian people|Armenian]]-populated region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] became disputed between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] when both countries gained independence from the [[Russian Empire]] in 1918. After the [[Soviet Union]] established its control over the area, in 1923 it created the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) within the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]. In the final years of the [[Soviet Union]], the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], culminating in a large-scale ethnic conflict and, eventually, in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] that was fought from 1991 to 1994.

On 10 December 1991, as the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was dissolving]], a referendum held in the NKAO and the neighboring [[Shahumian]] region resulted in a [[declaration of independence]] from Azerbaijan as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. The country remains diplomatically [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognised]] by UN-member states, including Armenia. [[Transnistria]], [[South Ossetia]], and [[Abkhazia]], all UN non-member states, recognise the state.<ref>[http://www.abhazia.info/property/48-2010-12-28-07-06-44/76-abkhazia-istoria.html About Abkhazia – Abkhazia.info].

Since a ceasefire in 1994, most of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and several regions of [[Azerbaijan]] around it remain under joint [[Military of Armenia|Armenian]] and [[Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army|Nagorno-Karabakh military]] control. Representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have since been holding peace talks mediated by the [[OSCE Minsk Group]].

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Nagorno-Karabakh}}
Nagorno-Karabakh is a [[Presidential system|presidential democracy]]. The [[Executive (government)|executive power]] rests mainly with the [[President of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|president]]. The president appoints and dismisses the prime minister.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The [[National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh]] is the parliament, forming a unicameral legislature. It has 33 members who are elected for 5 year terms.<ref name="National assembly">http://www.nkrusa.org/country_profile/national_assembly.shtml</ref> The current President is [[Bako Sahakian]].<ref>http://www.nkrusa.org/country_profile/president.shtml</ref>

The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has a [[multi-party]] system; as of 2009, American organization [[Freedom House]] ranks Nagorno-Karabakh Republic above the republics of [[Politics of Armenia|Armenia]] and [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] in terms of [[Political rights|political]] and [[civil rights]].<ref>[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2009&country=7557 freedomhouse.org: Map of Freedom in the World], ''[[Freedom House]]'', 2009</ref><ref>[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=22&year=2009&country=7560 freedomhouse.org: Map of Freedom in the World], ''[[Freedom House]]'', 2009</ref><ref>[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&year=2009&country=7740 freedomhouse.org: Map of Freedom in the World], ''[[Freedom House]]'', 2009</ref> Three organisations currently have members in the parliament, [[Artsakh Democratic Party]] has 18 members, [[Free Motherland]] has 8 members, and the [[Movement 88]] alliance has 3 members.<ref name="National assembly"/> A number of non-partisan candidates also take part in [[Elections in Nagorno-Karabakh|elections]], and with some success; in 2005, eight of the 33 members to the National Assembly successfully took their seat without officially running under the banner of [[List of political parties in Nagorno-Karabakh|established political parties]] in the republic.

===Constitution===
{{Main|Nagorno-Karabakh constitutional referendum, 2006}}
On 3 November 2006, the then President of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [[Arkadi Ghukasyan]] signed a decree to carry out a referendum on a draft Nagorno-Karabakh constitution.<ref>{{cite news

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Nagorno-Karabakh}}
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is based in [[Stepanakert]]. The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic operates five permanent Missions and one Bureau of Social-Politic Information in France. The NKR Permanent Missions exist in [[Armenia]], [[Australia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Russia]], the [[United States]], and one for Middle East countries based in [[Beirut]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nkr.am/en/permanent-representations/104/ |title=Permanent Representations |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic |accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> The goals of the offices are to present the Republic's positions on various issues, provide information and to facilitate the peace process.

The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is a member of the [[Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations]], commonly known as the "Commonwealth of Unrecognized States".

==Military==
{{Main|Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army|Nagorno-Karabakh War}}
The [[Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army]] was officially established on 9 May 1992 as a defense against Azerbaijan. It succeeded in fighting the Azerbaijani army to a ceasefire on 12 May 1994.<ref>http://www.nkrusa.org/country_profile/nkr_army.shtml</ref> Currently the Nagorno-Karabakh Defence Army consists of around 18,000–20,000 officers and soldiers. However, only 8,500 citizens from Nagorno-Karabakh serve in the NK army; some 10,000 come from Armenia. There are also 177–316 [[tank]]s, 256–324 additional fighting vehicles, and 291–322 guns and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s. Armenia supplies arms and other military necessities to Karabakh. Several battalions of Armenians army are deployed directly in the Karabakh zone on occupied Azerbaijani territory. <ref name="Blandy">Blandy, C. W.

Defence Academy of the United Kingdom, Caucasus Series 08/17, 2008, p.14.</ref>

The Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army fought the [[Battle of Shusha]] in 1992, involving the opening of the [[Lachin corridor]] between The Republic of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh (1992), and the defense of the [[Martakert]] front from 1992–1994.

===Land mines===
{{Main|Land mine situation in Nagorno Karabakh}}
The region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] is considered to be one of the most heavily [[Landmine|mined]] regions of the former [[Soviet Union]]. Mines were laid from 1991 to 1994 by both conflicting parties in the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The United Nations and the U.S. has estimated the number of mines in Nagorno-Karabakh at 100,000. There have been many civilian casualties resulting from the land mines. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) claims that 123 people have been killed and over 300 injured by landmines near the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh since a 1994 truce ended a six-year conflict between ethnic Armenian and Azerbaijani forces.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/2ddee253-7702-4739-adf4-69437770a55c.html UN: More Than 100 Killed By Mines Near Nagorno-Karabakh – Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty  2009<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The [[HALO Trust]] – UK based demining NGO, is the only other organisation conducting [[demining]] in Nagorno Karabakh.<ref>[http://www.halotrust.org/nagornokarabakh.html The HALO Trust demining Nagorno Karabakh]</ref>

==Current situation==
[[File:Nagorno Karabakh Current en.png|thumb|{{legend|#FDF5DF|Territory controlled by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic}}{{legend|#F8C54E|Claimed by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic but controlled by Azerbaijan}}]]

Today, Nagorno-Karabakh is a ''de facto'' independent state, calling itself the ''Nagorno-Karabakh Republic''. It is closely tied to the Republic of Armenia and uses the same currency, the [[Dram (currency)|dram]]. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], "from the beginning of the Karabakh conflict, Armenia provided aid, weapons, and volunteers. Armenian involvement in Karabakh escalated after a December 1993 Azerbaijani offensive. The Republic of Armenia began sending conscripts and regular Army and Interior Ministry troops to fight in Karabakh."<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/WR95/HELSINKI-01.htm Human Rights Watch World Report 1995]</ref> The politics of Armenia and the de-facto Karabakh republic are so intermingled that a former president of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, [[Robert Kocharyan]], became first the prime minister (1997) and then the president of Armenia (1998 to 2008).

Still, successive Armenian governments have resisted internal pressure to unite the two, due to ongoing negotiations under the auspices of the [[OSCE Minsk Group]]. In his case study of Eurasia, Dov Lynch of the Institute for Security Studies of WEU believes that "Karabakh's independence allows the new Armenian state to avoid the international stigma of aggression, despite the fact that Armenian troops fought in the war between 1991–94 and continue to man the Line of Contact between Karabakh and Azerbaijan." Lynch also cites that the "strength of the Armenian armed forces, and Armenia's strategic alliance with Russia, are seen as key shields protecting the Karabakh state by the authorities in Stepanakert."<ref>[http://aei.pitt.edu/707/01/occ32.pdf Institute for Security Studies of WEU. Dov Lynch. Managing separatist states: A Eurasian case study.]</ref>
At present, the mediation process is at a standstill, with the most recent discussions in [[Rambouillet]], France, yielding no agreement. Azerbaijan's position has been that Armenian troops withdraw from [[Security belt of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic|all areas of Azerbaijan outside Nagorno-Karabakh]], and that all displaced persons be allowed to return to their homes before the status of Karabakh can be discussed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Armenia does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as being legally part of Azerbaijan, arguing that because the region declared independence at the same time that Azerbaijan became an independent state, both of them are equally [[successor state]]s of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nkr.am/en/history-and-current-reality/79/ |title=Nagorno Karabagh Republic: History and Current Reality |author=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic |accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/news/inthenews/20090304_politique_president.html |title=Interview of President Serzh Sargsyan to "Politique Internationale" Journal |date=4 March 2009 |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Armenia Official Site |accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref> The Armenian government insists that the government of Nagorno-Karabakh be part of any discussions on the region's future, and rejects ceding occupied territory or allowing refugees to return before talks on the region's status.<ref>{{cite web| url         =http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/pr_10/100216_balayan.html| title       =Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia on a question of "Haylur" News Program| date =16 February 2010| publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Armenia Official Site}}</ref>

Representatives of Armenia, Azerbaijan, France, Russia and the United States met in Paris and in [[Key West]], Florida, in the Spring of 2001.<ref name="state2001">[http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/2001/2098.htm U.S. Department of State – Armenia and Azerbaijan: Key West Peace Talks]</ref> Despite rumours that the parties were close to a solution, the Azerbaijani authorities&nbsp;— both during [[Heydar Aliyev]]'s period of office, and after the accession of his son [[Ilham Aliyev]] in the October 2003 elections&nbsp;— have firmly denied that any agreement was reached in Paris or Key West.

[[File:Free Artsakh welcomes you (sign).jpg|thumb|Sign stating "Free Artsakh Welcomes You" along the road entering the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic from [[Goris]] to [[Berdzor]]]]

Further talks between the Azerbaijani and Armenian presidents, Ilham Aliyev and Robert Kocharyan, were held in September 2004 in Astana, [[Kazakhstan]], on the sidelines of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) summit. Reportedly, one of the suggestions put forward was the withdrawal of the occupying forces from the Azeri territories adjacent to Nagorno-Karabakh, and holding [[referendum]]s (plebiscites) in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan proper regarding the future status of the region. On 10 and 11 February 2006, Kocharyan and Aliyev met in [[Rambouillet]], France, to discuss the fundamental principles of a settlement to the conflict. Contrary to the initial optimism, the Rambouillet talks did not produce any agreement, with key issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh and whether Armenian troops would withdraw from [[Kalbajar]] still being contentious.<ref>Karl Rahder, "Nagorno-Karabakh summit ends in failure," ISN Security Watch, 27 Feb 2006, http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?id=14904</ref>

Talks were held at the Polish embassy in [[Bucharest]] in June 2006.<ref>[http://news.ft.com/cms/s/5da3077e-f4f8-11da-86f6-0000779e2340.html 'Marathon' talks on Nagorno-Karabakh]</ref> Again, American, Russian, and French diplomats attended the talks that lasted over 40 minutes.<ref>[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18315 Kocharyan-Aliyev Meeting Over in Bucharest]</ref> Earlier, Armenian President Kocharyan announced that he was ready to "continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions."<ref>[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18307 Yerevan Ready to Continue Dialogue with Baku for Karabakh Settlement]</ref>

Unfortunately, according to Armenian foreign minister, [[Vardan Oskanyan]], no progress was made at this latest meeting. Both presidents failed to reach a consensus on the issues from the earlier Rambouillet conference. He noted that the Kocharyan-Aliyev meeting was held in a normal atmosphere. "Nevertheless," he added, "the foreign ministers of the two countries are commissioned to continue talks over settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and try to find common points before the next meeting of the presidents."<ref>[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=18318&page=1 No Progress at Kocharyan-Aliyev Meeting in Bucharest]</ref>

The major disagreement between both sides at the Bucharest conference was the status of Karabakh. Azerbaijan's position was a promise to give Karabakh the "highest status of autonomy adopted in the world."<ref>[http://www.regnum.ru/english/polit/661396.html Nagorno-Karabakh FM: Granting Autonomy To Nagorno-Karabakh Is Out Of Baku Competence]</ref> Armenia favored a popular vote by the inhabitants of Karabakh to decide their future, a position that was also taken by the international mediators.<ref>[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/06/2ED65C9D-891F-4121-AB6D-0694253B835D.asp U.S. Confirms Vote Option For Karabakh]</ref> The response to the Armenian position from Baku was that of a threat to Azerbaijan's territorial integrity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} On 27 June, the Armenian foreign minister said both parties agreed to allow the residents of Karabakh to vote regarding the future status of the region.<ref>[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2006/06/00DB055C-7469-4805-A919-3395C5858110.ASP Armenian, Azeri Leaders ‘Agreed To Karabakh Referendum’]</ref> The Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs officially refuted that statement.<ref>[http://www.today.az/news/politics/27642.html Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry about latest statement of Armenia on Nagorno Karabakh]</ref> According to Azeri opposition leader [[Isa Gambar]], however, Azerbaijan did indeed agree to the referendum. Still, nothing official has confirmed this yet.<ref>[http://www.today.az/news/politics/27666.html Isa Gambar: "Baku Gave OK On Referendum In Nagorno-Karabakh"]</ref>

The ongoing "Prague Process" overseen by the OSCE Minsk Group was brought into sharp relief in the summer of 2006 with a series of rare public revelations seemingly designed to jump-start the stalled negotiations. After the release in June of a paper outlining its position, which had until then been carefully guarded, U.S. State Department official [[Matthew Bryza]] told Radio Free Europe that the Minsk Group favored a referendum in Karabakh that would determine its final status. The referendum, in the view of the OSCE, should take place not in Azerbaijan as a whole, but in Nagorno-Karabakh only.

According to an analysis by [[New England School of Law]]'s Center for International Law & Policy, "Nagorno Karabagh has a right of self-determination, including the attendant right to independence, according to the criteria recognized under international law." As the analysis elaborates, "the principle of self-determination is included in Articles 1, 55, and 73 of the United Nations Charter," and it has been "codified in the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]--which are considered to constitute the international 'Bill of Rights.'" Furthermore, "the right to self-determination has also been repeatedly recognized in a series of resolutions adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, the most important of which is Resolution 2625(XXV) of 1970." As the analysis continues, "the Azerbaijanis argue that political independence for Nagorno Karabagh violates the right of Azerbaijan to territorial integrity. But the claim to territorial integrity can be negated where a state does not conduct itself 'in compliance with the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples' and does not allow a subject people 'to pursue their economic, social and cultural development' as required by United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2625(XXV). Moreover, it should be noted that when Azerbaijan declared independence from the Soviet Union, it claimed to be the successor state to the Azerbaijani Republic of 1918–1920.

The [[League of Nations]], however, did not recognize Azerbaijan's inclusion of Nagorno Karabagh within Azerbaijan's claimed territory." The analysis further states that Nagorno Karabakh's secession was in compliance with the existing Soviet law. Following Soviet Azerbaijan's declaration of independence on 30 August 1991, "Nagorno Karabagh initiated the same process through the joint adoption of the 'Declaration of the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh' by the local legislative councils of Nagorno Karabagh and the bordering Armenian-populated [[Shahumian]] district. The only difference was that, for Karabagh, independence was declared not from the Soviet Union but from Azerbaijan.

This act fully complied with existing law. Indeed, the 1990 Soviet law titled 'Law of the USSR Concerning the Procedure of Secession of a Soviet Republic from the USSR,' provides that the secession of a Soviet republic from the body of the USSR allows an autonomous region and compactly settled minority regions in the same republic's territory also to trigger its own process of independence." This act, as the analysis continues, was not annulled by the "USSR Constitutional Oversight Committee," as the "declaration was deemed in compliance with the then existing law." Furthermore, "on 10 December 1991, the Nagorno Karabagh Republic held its own referendum on independence in the presence of international observers. The vote overwhelmingly approved Karabagh's sovereignty. This action of Nagorno Karabagh, which at that time was part of a still existent and internationally recognized Soviet Union, corresponded fully with the relevant Soviet law pertaining to leaving the USSR." Finally, on 6 January 1992, the "parliament of Karabagh adopted its Declaration of Independence on the basis of the referendum results."<ref>[http://www.nesl.edu/center/pubs/nagorno.pdf The Nagorno-Karabagh Crisis: A Blueprint for Resolution] New England Center for International Law & Policy</ref>

A background paper prepared by the [[Directorate General of Political Affairs]] of the Council of Europe for the seminar "Youth and Conflict Resolution" (Strasbourg, 31 March – 2 April 2003), on the other hand, states, "The Armenian side maintains that the N-K independence referendum was conducted in accordance with the USSR law on the 'Procedure for Solving Issues of Secession of a Soviet Republic from the USSR' of 3 April 1990. Article 3 of this law provided autonomous regions within the Soviet republics with the right to determine independently, by referendum, whether they wished to remain within the USSR or join the republic seceding from the USSR. It would however seem that according to this law N-K would have the choice of two options&nbsp;– to remain within the USSR or to join independent Azerbaijan; N-K independence does not seem possible".<ref name=10264-2>Mr [[David Atkinson (politician)|David Atkinson]], United Kingdom, European Democrat Group, (Rapporteur) [http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/WorkingDocs/doc04/EDOC10364.htm The conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region dealt with by the OSCE Minsk Conference], [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], 29 November 2004.

According to the article in "The Journal of Conflict Resolution", the Armenian side "justified its claim by Article 70 of the Soviet Constitution, which affirms the right to self-determination of the peoples of the USSR. In fact, this recognition of the principle of self-determination is only part of a general declaratory statement about the nature of the Soviet federation: “The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is an integral, federal, multi-national state formed on the principle of socialist federalism as a result of the free self-determination of nations and the voluntary association of equal Soviet Socialist Republics. The USSR embodies the state unity of the Soviet people and draws all its nations and nationalities together for the purpose of jointly building communism.” There is no mechanism, other than the right of the union republics to secede (Article 72 of the constitution), through which to express the right of self-determination".<ref>Niall M. Fraser; Keith W. Hipel; John Jaworsky; Ralph Zuljan. A Conflict Analysis of the Armenian-Azerbaijani Dispute. The Journal of Conflict Resolution, Vol. 34, No. 4. (Dec., 1990), pp. 652–677.</ref>

The actual declaration of establishment of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, issued on 2 September 1991, states that the republic is proclaimed pursuant to the USSR law of secession, and that it "enjoys the authorities given to Republics by the USSR Constitution and legislation and reserves the right to decide independently the issue of its state-legal status based on political consultations and negotiations with the leadership of Union and Republics." The Declaration further states that "the USSR Constitution and legislation, as well as other laws currently in force, which do not contradict the goals and principles of this Declaration and peculiarities of the Republic apply on the territory of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, until the NKR Constitution and laws are adopted."<ref>[http://www.nkr.am/eng/deklaraciya209.html, Declaration on Proclamation of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic]</ref>

However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan states that "according to this Law, in a Union republic containing autonomous republics, autonomous provinces and autonomous regions, the referendum had to be held separately in each autonomous unit, the people of which retained the right to decide independently the question of staying in the USSR or in the seceding Union republic, as well as to raise the question of their own state-legal status. It is important to emphasize that the secession of a Union republic from the USSR could be regarded valid only after the fulfillment of complicated and multi-staged procedure and, finally, the adoption of the relevant decision by the Congress of the USSR People's Deputies. However, until the Soviet Union ceased to exist as international person the mentioned Law was without legal effect, since no Union republic, including Azerbaijan and Armenia, had used the procedure for secession stipulated in it".<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.az/eng/armenian_aggresion/legal/index.shtml Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan Republic.

The [[OSCE Minsk Group]] has allowed the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (referring to it as the "leadership of Nagorny Karabakh"), as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, to participate in the peace process as "parties to the conflict," and the [[Azerbaijani Community of Nagorno-Karabakh|Azerbaijani community of the region]] – as an "interested party". The Chairman of the CSCE Minsk Conference mentioned that "the terms 'party to the conflict' and 'leadership of Nagorny Karabakh' do not imply recognition of any diplomatic or political status under domestic or international law".<ref>[http://www.un.int/azerbaijan/documents/minsk/S26522.pdf Letter Dated 1 October 1993 from the permanent representative to the United Nations addressed to the president of the Security Council](PDF)</ref><ref>[http://assembly.coe.int/Documents/AdoptedText/ta94/erec1251.htm Recommendation 1251 (1994)1 on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh] by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe</ref> The Azerbaijani community is led by [[Bayram Safarov]], the head of the executive power of Shusha region.

The resolution also calls for withdrawal of Armenian forces from all occupied territories of Azerbaijan, accompanied by deployment of international forces to be organised with respect of the UN Charter in order to provide the necessary security guarantees in a period of transition,  which will ensure the security of the population of Nagorno-Karabakh and allow the displaced persons to return to their homes and further conflicts caused by homelessness to be prevented; and states that the EU believes that the position according to which Nagorno-Karabakh includes all occupied Azerbaijani lands surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh should rapidly be abandoned.

The Nagorno Karabakh conflict has resulted in the displacement of 528,000 (this figure does not include new born children of these IDPs) Azerbaijanis from Armenian territories including Nagorno Karabakh, and 220,000 Azeris, 18,000 Kurds and 3,500 Russians fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan from 1988 to 1989. The Azerbaijani government has estimated that 63 percent of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs) lived below the poverty line as compared to 49% of the total population. About 154,000 lived in the capital, Baku. According to the International Organization for Migration, 40,000 IDPs lived in camps, 60,000 in underground dugout shelters, and 20,000 in railway cars. Forty-thousand IDPs lived in EU-funded settlements and UNHCR provided housing for another 40,000. Another 5,000 IDPs lived in abandoned or rapidly deteriorating schools. Others lived in trains, on roadsides in half-constructed buildings, or in public buildings such as tourist and health facilities. Tens of thousands lived in seven tent camps where poor water supply and sanitation caused gastro-intestinal infections, tuberculosis, and malaria.<ref>[http://news.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/hundreds_of_thousands_of_people_displaced/ Hundreds of thousands of people displaced]. ''[[Amnesty International]]''. 28 June 2007. Retrieved 20 January 2008.</ref>

The Azerbaijani government has been unwilling to integrate the IDPs into the rest of the population as this could be interpreted as acceptance of the permanent loss of Nagorno-Karabakh.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The government required IDPs to register their place of residence in an attempt to better target the limited and largely inadequate national and international assistance due to the Armenian advocated and US imposed restrictions on humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan. Many IDPs were from rural areas and found it difficult to integrate into the urban labor market. Many international humanitarian agencies reduced or ceased assistance for IDPs citing increasing oil revenues of the country.<ref name="wrs2005">[http://www.refugees.org/countryreports.aspx?cid=1301 World Refugee Survey: Azerbaijan report 2005]</ref> The infant mortality among displaced Azerbaijani children is 3–4 times higher than in the rest of the population.

280,000 persons—virtually all ethnic Armenians who fled Azerbaijan during the 1988–1993 war over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh—were living in refugee-like circumstances in Armenia.<ref name="wrs2001"/> Some left the country, principally to Russia. Their children born in Armenia acquire citizenship automatically. Their numbers are thus subject to constant decline due to departure, and de-registration required for naturalization. Of these, about 250,000 fled Azerbaijan-proper (areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh); approximately 30,000 came from Nagorno-Karabakh.

==Geography==
The Nagorno-Karabakh republic is very mountainous, a feature which has given it the nickname "Mountain Karabakh". It is {{convert|11500|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} in area, bordering [[Armenia]], Azerbaijan, and [[Iran]]. The highest peaks in the country are  [[Mount Mrav]], {{convert|3340|m|ft|0}}, and [[Mount Kirs]] {{convert|2725|m|ft|0}}. The largest water body is the [[Sarsang reservoir]], and the major rivers are the [[Terter river|Terter]] and [[Khachen river|Khachen]] rivers.<ref name="Overview">http://www.nkrusa.org/country_profile/overview.shtml</ref> The country is on a plateau which slopes downwards towards the east and southeast, with the average altitude being {{convert|3600|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. Most rivers in the country flowing towards the [[Artsakh valley]].<ref name="Geography">http://www.nkrusa.org/country_profile/geography.shtml</ref>

The climate is mild and temperate. The average temperature is {{convert|11|C|F|0}}, which fluctuates annually between {{convert|22|C|F|0}} in July and {{convert|-1|C|F|0}} in January. The average precipitation can reach {{convert|71|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in some regions, and it is foggy for over 100 days a year.<ref name="Geography"/>

Over 2000 kinds of plants exist in Nagorno-Karabakh, and more than 36% of the country is forested. The plant life on the [[steppes]] is mostly semi-desert vegetation, and [[alpine tundra|alpine]] and [[tundra]] environments can be found above the forest in the highlands and mountains.<ref name="Geography"/>

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic}}

The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic has eight administrative divisions. Their territories include the five districts of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO), the [[Shahumian]] district in the Azerbaijan SSR which is currently under Azerbaijani control, and the seven rayons around the former NKAO that are under the control of the NKR forces.

Following the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's declaration of independence, the Azerbaijani government abolished the NKAO and created Azerbaijani rayons in its place. As a result, some of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic's divisions correspond with the [[Administrative divisions of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani rayons]], while others have different borders. A comparative table of the current divisions of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic and the corresponding rayons of Azerbaijan follows:<ref name="azerbregions">[http://www.travel-images.com/az-karabakh.html Azerb.com&nbsp;— Regions]</ref>

The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic claims Shahumian, which was not part of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. Representatives from Shahumian declared independence along with Nagorno-Karabakh, and the proclamation of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic includes the Shahumian region within its borders.<ref>http://www.nkr.am/eng/deklaraciya209.html</ref> Unlike the rest of Nagorno-Karabakh, Shahumian remains under Azerbaijani control.

Additional rayons of Azerbaijan are under Karabakh military control and are now part of the NKR: [[Lachin]], [[Qubadli]], [[Zangilan]], [[Jabrayil]], [[Kalbajar]] as well as parts of [[Agdam Rayon|Agdam]] and [[Fizuli]]. On the other hand, the eastern ends of Martakert and Martuni are under Azerbaijani control, as is the whole of Shahumian.

Most of the Armenian population in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic is Christian and belongs to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] which is an [[Oriental Orthodox]] Church.

Certain [[Orthodox Christianity|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Evangelical]] denominations also exist; other religions include Judaism.<ref name="Overview"/> However, military authorities prohibited any Christian sect activity in Nagorno-Karabakh, for the reason that they would preach [[pacifism]] among population. <ref>[http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/nemcy/index.htm Правозащитный центр «Мемориал», Россия]</ref>

The [[Gandzasar monastery]] ("Գանձասար" in Armenian) is a historical monastery in Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). Another is [[Dadivank Monastery]] ({{lang-hy|Դադիվանք}}) also Khutavank ({{lang-hy|Խութավանք}} – Monastery on the Hill) that was built between the 9th and 13th century. The Nagorno Karabakh government’s aim is to include the Gandzasar Monastery into the directory of the UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites.

[[Ghazanchetsots Cathedral]] (built 1868–1888) (Սուրբ Ամենափրկիչ Ղազանչեցոց Եկեղեցի in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]), also known as the ''Cathedral of Christ the Savior'' and the ''Shushi Cathedral'', is an [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian church]] located in [[Shushi]], Nagorno-Karabakh.

[[Saint Yeghishe Arakyal Monastery]] (5th–13th centuries) commemorating St. Yeghishe, the famous evangelizer of Armenia’s eastern lands. The church serves as a burial ground for the 5th century’s King Vachagan II the Pious, the most well-known representative of the Arranshahik line of east Armenian monarchs. The monastery is located in the [[Martakert]] District.

[[Dadivank Monastery]] (13th century) is reportedly the largest Armenian monastery in the Caucasus. The western facade of Dadivank’s Memorial Cathedral bears one of the most extensive Armenian lapidary (inscribed-in-stone) texts. Dadivank is named after St. Dadi, a disciple of Apostle Thaddeus who preached Holy Gospel in Artsakh in the 1st century. St. Dadi’s tomb was discovered by archeologists in 2007. The monastery is in the [[Shahumian]] District.

[[Gtichavank]] Monastery (13th century) has design features shared with the architectural style of medieval Armenia’s capital city of Ani. The monastery is located in the [[Hadrut]] District.

[[File:ArtsakhBank in Stepankert.jpg|thumb|right|The central office of Artsakh Bank was opened in 2004 in Stepanakert.]]

The socio-economic situation of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic was greatly affected by the conflict. Yet, foreign investments are beginning to come. The origin of most venture capital comes from Armenians in Armenia, Russia, United States, France, Australia, Iran, and the Middle East.

Notably the telecommunications sector was developed with Karabakh Telecom<ref>[http://www.karabakhtelecom.com/ Karabakh Telecom site]</ref> investing millions of dollars in mobile telephony, spearheaded by a Lebanese company.

Copper and gold mining has been advancing since 2002 with development and launch of operations at [[Drmbon]] deposit.<ref>[http://www.bm.am/en/about/history.htm Base Metals LLC – History]</ref> Approximately 27–28 thousand tons (wet weight) of concentrates are produced<ref>[http://stat-nkr.am/files/yearbooks/2002_2008/15_Prom.pdf Statistical Yearbook of NKR 2002–2008, p. 169]</ref> with average copper content of 19–21% and gold content of 32–34 g/t.<ref>[http://www.bm.am/en/group/product.htm Base Metals LLC – Product]</ref>

The banking system is also flourishing with [[Artsakhbank]] (the state bank) and a number of Armenian banks. The republic presently uses the [[Armenian dram]].

Wine growing and processing of agricultural products, particularly wine (i.e. storage of wine, wine stuff, cognac alcohol) is one of the prioritized directions of the economic development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/fr/nk/nk.pdf |title=Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh: Process of State Building at the Crossroad of Centuries  |year=2009 |publisher=“Institute of Political Research” SNCO |accessdate=22 March 2011}}.</ref>

===Tourism===
The Republic is developing tourist industry geared to Armenia and the [[Armenian diaspora]].  The Republic has been showing a major increase in tourists over the last several years, which keeps growing because of Karabakh's many cultural sights. There are 8 hotels in Stepanakert. The Artsakh development agency says 4,000 tourists visited Nagorno-Karabakh Republic in 2005. The figures rose to 8,000 in 2010 (excluding visitors from [[Armenia]]).<ref>{{cite news

[[File:Karintak-IMG 1445.JPG|thumb|right|Section of Janapar trail]]
[[Janapar]] is a marked trail through mountains, valleys and villages of Nagorno-Karabakh, with monasteries and fortresses along the way. The trail is broken into day hikes, which will bring tourists to a different village each night.<ref>''Walk'', the magazine of [[The Ramblers]], Summer 2009, "Up the Garden Path" p 67-69. Laurence Mitchell.</ref> The paths have existed for centuries, but now are marked specifically for hikers. The Himnakan Janapar (backbone trail), marked in 2007, leads from the northwest region of [[Shahumian]] to the southern town of [[Hadrut]]. Side trails and mini trails take one to additional parts of Karabakh. The important sites passed along this hike include [[Dadivank Monastery]], [[Gandzasar monastery]], [[Shushi]], the Karkar Canyon with its high cliffs, Zontik Waterfall and the ruins of Hunot and [[Gtichavank]] monastery.

==Transportation==
The transportation system damaged by the conflict has been noticeably improved during the last several years: the North-South Karabakh motorway alone has largely facilitated in the development of the transportation system.

The 169-kilometer Hadrut-Stepanakert-Askeran-Martakert motorway, the locals say is the lifeline of Karabakh. $25 million donated during the Hayastan All-Armenian Foundation telethons have been allotted for the construction of the road.

The route from the Armenian capital [[Yerevan]] to the Nagorno-Karabakh capital [[Stepanakert]] now takes around 4 hours instead of the former 8–9 hours.

The sole civilian airport of Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, located about 8&nbsp;km east of the capital, has been closed since the onset of the war more than 20 years ago.  However, the government is pressing ahead with plans to reopen the airport by early 2011, and raised about 1 billion drams ($2.8 million) for its reconstruction from unspecified “charitable sources.”  It began building a new airport terminal and repairing the runway in late 2009.  It is expected that Karabakh will have a regular flight service only with Armenia, at least in the near future. Its unresolved status makes direct air communication with other countries all but impossible.

The Stepanakert-Yerevan flights will be carried out from the newly renovated [[Stepanakert Airport]] by a state-run airline, [[Artsakh Air]], beginning in Summer 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stepanakert airport to start operating before September|url=http://int.armradio.am/?part=1&id=96678|accessdate=19 May 2011|newspaper=ArmRadio|date=2011-05-11}}</ref> Artsakh Air's fleet of aircraft will consist of three Canadian-made [[CRJ200]] passenger jets.<ref>http://asbarez.com/92408/karabakh-gears-up-for-first-comercial-flights-in-decades/</ref>

==Education==
Education in Nagorno-Karabakh is compulsory, and is free up to the age of 18. The education system is inherited from the [[Education in the Soviet Union|old system]] of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>http://www.nkrusa.org/country_profile/education.shtml</ref>

Nagorno-Karabakh's school system was severely damaged because of the conflict. But the government of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic with considerable aid from the Republic of [[Armenia]] and donations from the [[Armenian diaspora]] has rebuilt many of the schools. The republic has around 250 schools of various sizes, with more than 200 lying in the regions. The student population estimated at more than 20,000 study, with almost half in the capital city of Stepanakert.

[[Artsakh State University]] was founded by Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenian governments’ joint efforts, with main campus in [[Stepanakert]]. The university opening ceremony took place on 10 May 1992.

Yerevan University of Management also opened a branch in [[Stepanakert]].

There's also more modern items, from the 19th century to World War II and from events of the Karabakh Independence War.

Karabakh has its own brand of popular music. As Karabakh question became a pan-Armenian question, Karabakh music was further promoted worldwide.

Also as a result of the Karabakh conflict, there has also been a series of nationalistic songs done by Karabakh artists as well as artists from Republic of [[Armenia]] and the [[Armenian diaspora]] to rally support for Karabakh independence movement accompanied by footage of Karabakh military campaigns. These can be found abundantly in popular online sites such as YouTube etc., with some lively pro and anti-Karabakh discussions that these videos almost always generate.
