'''''No Prayer for the Dying''''' is the eighth studio [[album]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]]. The record marks the band's first line-up change since 1983; guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] left the band during the pre-production phase, unhappy with the musical direction it was taking,<ref name="Wall 283"/> and only having contributed to one song, "Hooks in You".<ref name="Wall 286"/> Smith was replaced by [[Janick Gers]], who had previously worked with singer [[Bruce Dickinson]] on his first solo-album, ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'',<ref name="Wall 281">{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography (3rd ed.)| publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=281}}</ref> and had also worked with [[Ian Gillan]]<ref name= "Allmusic"/> and [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]] band, [[White Spirit (band)|White Spirit]].<ref name="Wall 278">{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography (3rd ed.)| publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=278}}</ref>

==Background==

The album departed from the keyboard and synth saturated [[progressive rock]] direction of the band's two previous studio outings (1986's ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'' and 1988's ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'') in favour of a more "stripped down," straight forward style, befitting the band's earlier material,<ref name="Wall 283">{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography (3rd ed.)| publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=283}}</ref> which ushered in a change of vocal style for [[Bruce Dickinson]] from the operatic sound of the 1980s to a raspier way of singing.<ref name= "Sputnikmusic"/> The idea to make a more "street level" release also inspired the band to record in a barn on bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris']] property in Essex, using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]].<ref name="Wall 283"/> Dickinson states that this idea was a mistake, commenting that "it was shit! It was a shit-sounding record and I wished we hadn't done it that way. At the time, I was as guilty as anyone else in going, 'Oh great! Look, we're all covered in straw! What a larf!'"<ref name= "CR 2000">{{cite journal | title = The Wicked Man| journal = Classic Rock | date = 2000-06-01 | issue = 15 | pages = 36–43 }}</ref>

The album also departed from literary and fantasy lyrical themes in favour of more current political content, with songs focusing on religious exploitation (such as in the record's first single, "[[Holy Smoke (song)|Holy Smoke]]") and social concerns ("Public Enema Number One").<ref name="Wall 286">{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography (3rd ed.)| publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=286}}</ref> ''No Prayer for the Dying'' is the only Iron Maiden studio album to date without a song exceeding six minutes in length and the only one to contain profanity in the lyrics. It was also the band's first release with [[Epic Records]] in the U.S., after the band left [[Capitol Records]], but was sold through [[EMI]] for all territories outside the [[United States]]. Despite charting well in most countries, particularly in the UK where it debuted at No.&nbsp;2,<ref name="Wall 286"/> it would be the band's last album to receive gold certification in the U.S.<ref name= "Allmusic"/>

''No Prayer for the Dying'' also includes the hit song, "[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]", which, in spite of a ban by the [[BBC]], remains Iron Maiden's only UK No.&nbsp;1 single to date.<ref name="Wall 286"/> Written by Dickinson and originally recorded with his solo band for the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'' film soundtrack, Steve Harris decided that the song would be "great for Maiden" and had the band rerecord it.<ref name="Wall 282">{{cite book | author=Wall, Mick | title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography (3rd ed.)| publisher=Sanctuary Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=282}}</ref>

Following Bruce Dickinson's departure from Iron Maiden in 1993, songs from ''No Prayer for the Dying'' have been largely ignored at live performances. "Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter" was the only song played on a post-1993 set list, appearing on the band's 2003 summer tour.

[[No Prayer On The Road]] was the [[Concert tour|tour]] in support of the [[album]].

==Album cover==
''No Prayer for the Dying'' was the first album not to feature a wrap-around cover since 1983's ''[[Piece of Mind]]''. It also does not follow the continuity of previous album covers, as [[Eddie the Head|Eddie]] no longer exhibits either his lobotomy or cyborg enhancements.<ref name= "BBC Eddie"> {{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A444601 | title = Eddie - mascot of Iron Maiden | accessdate = 2011-09-23}}</ref>

Two versions of the cover exist. The original 1990 version has Eddie bursting from his grave and grabbing a grave-digger by the neck. As the band's manager, [[Rod Smallwood]], disliked the figure, he asked artist [[Derek Riggs]] to remove him from the cover for the 1998 re-release,<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Popoff | first1 = Martin | title = Run for Cover: The Art of Derek Riggs | edition = 1 | publisher = Aardvark Publishing | year = 2006 | page = 114 | accessdate = 2011-10-26 | isbn = 1-4276-0538-6}}</ref> although the original artwork is used on the disc itself. Additionally an inscription was added to the [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] on the tomb, which Riggs had initially left blank to allow the band to add their own words,<ref> {{cite web | url = http://derek.server311.com/riggsart/Pages/maiden.dir/11prayer02.html | title = Derek Riggs- No Prayer for the Dying commentary | accessdate = 2011-10-26}}</ref> and reads "After the Daylight, The Night of Pain, That is not Dead, Which Can Rise Again."  The picture disc LP shows Eddie firing a weapon made of four machine guns (a reference to the album's opening track, "Tailgunner"). It has the original cover on side 2.

Reviews for the album were generally poor, with [[Allmusic]] commenting that "the songwriting wasn't up to snuff when compared to such classics as ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'' or ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|Number of the Beast]]''" and "as a whole doesn't measure up to the hits."<ref name= "Allmusic"></ref> [[Sputnikmusic]] were equally negative, stating that "No Prayer for the Dying is a plain, listless record that never really gets itself going."<ref name= "Sputnikmusic"></ref>
