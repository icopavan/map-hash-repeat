'''Fenâri Îsâ Mosque''' (full name in {{lang-tr|Molla Fenâri Îsâ Câmîi}}), in [[Byzantine]] times known as the '''Lips Monastery''' ({{lang-el|Μονή του Λιβός}}), is a [[mosque]] in [[Istanbul]], made of two former [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches.

==Location==
The complex is located in the [[Fatih]] district of [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], along the ''Adnan Menderes'' (formerly ''Vatan'') Caddesi (Avenue), in a modern context.

==History==
=== Byzantine period ===
[[File:Saint Eudocia Mosaic Istanbul.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Coloured stone inlay on marble depicting [[Eudoxia of Heliopolis|Saint Eudocia]], 10./11. century, previously in the church, now in [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]].]]
In 908, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] admiral [[Constantine Lips]]<ref>The name of the founder has been found in an inscription on the cornice of the apse. Krautheimer (1986), p. 409.</ref> inaugurated a [[nunnery]] in the presence of the Emperor [[Leo VI the Wise]] (r. 886–912).<ref name="mw126">Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 126</ref> The nunnery was dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin]] [[Theotokos]] ("Immaculate Mother of God") in a place called "Merdosangaris" ({{lang-el|Μερδοσαγγάρης}}),<ref>This [[toponym]] has a [[Persian language|Persian]] etymology ("Merd-il-sachra"), and is composed of the two [[Middle Persian|Persian]] words ''Merdo'' (meaning "man"), and ''sachra'' (meaning "solitude"): "Man of solitude". Janin (1964), p. 361.</ref> in the valley of the Lycus (the river of Constantinople).<ref name=mw126/> The nunnery was known also after his name (''Monē tou Libos''), and became one of the largest of [[Constantinople]].

The church was built on the remains of another shrine from the 6th century,<ref name="gul258">Gülersoy (1976), p. 258.</ref> and used the tombstones of an ancient Roman cemetery.<ref name="mw126"/> [[Relics]] of [[Saint Irene]] were stored here. The church is generally known as "North Church". 

[[File:North Church Constantinople.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Byzantine remains from the North Church (kept in the Istanbul Archaeological Museums).]]
After the [[Fourth Crusade|Latin invasion]] and the restoration of the Byzantine Empire, between 1286 and 1304, Empress [[Theodora Doukaina Vatatzina|Theodora]], widow of Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1259–1282), erected another church dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]] (Eκκλησία του Αγίου Ιωάννου Προδρόμου του Λίβος)<ref>This church was added to the thirty five ones dedicated to this Saint, which existed in Constantinople in the tenth century! Krautheimer (1986), p. 436</ref> south of the first church. Several exponents of the imperial dynasty of the [[Palaiologos]] were buried there besides Theodora: her son Constantine, Empress [[Irene of Montferrat|Irene]] of [[Monferrato|Montferrat]] and her husband Emperor [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]] (r. 1282–1328).<ref name=gul258/> This church is generally known as the "South Church". 
The Empress restored also the nunnery, which by that time had been possibly abandoned.<ref name=ne337>Talbot (2001), p. 337</ref> According to its ''[[typikon]]'', the nunnery at that time hosted a total of 50 women<ref name=ne337/><ref>Krautheimer (1986), p. 409.</ref> and also a ''Xenon''<ref>This was a charitable institution, something between an hospital and a nursing home. Talbot (2001), p. 337</ref> for laywomen with 15 beds attached.<ref name="mw126"/> 

During the 14th century an [[Narthex|esonarthex]] and a [[parekklesion]]<ref>The ''parekklesion'' is a [[chapel]] leaning to the side of the church or of the narthex.</ref> were added to the church. The custom of burying members of the imperial family in the complex continued in the 15th century with [[Anna of Moscow|Anna]], first wife of Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1425–1448), in 1417.<ref name=mw127>Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 127.</ref><ref>Freely says that Anna was buried in the dead of night to avoid creating a public panic due to rumors of the Bubonic plague.</ref> The church was possibly used as a cemetery also after 1453.<ref name=mw127/>

=== Ottoman period ===
In 1497–1498, shortly after the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and during the reign of Sultan [[Beyazid II]] (1481–1512), the south church was converted into a ''mescit'' (a small mosque) by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dignitary Fenarizade Alâeddin Ali ben Yusuf Effendi, ''[[Qadi 'asker]]''<ref>The ''Qadi 'asker'' ("Army-Judge") was the supreme military magistrate, and was one of the most important figures in the [[State organisation of the Ottoman Empire]].</ref> of [[Rumeli]], and nephew of [[Molla Şemseddin Fenari]],<ref name=mw126/> whose family belonged to the religious class of the [[ulema]]. He built a [[minaret]] in the southeast angle, and a [[mihrab]] in the [[apse]].<ref name=mw127/> Since one of the head preachers of the [[madrasah]] was named ''Îsâ'' ("Jesus" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), his name was added to that of the mosque. The edifice burned down in 1633, was restored in 1636 by [[Grand Vizier]] [[Bayram Pasha]], who upgraded the building to ''cami'' ("mosque") and converted the north church into a [[Khanqah|tekke]] (a [[dervish]] lodge). In this occasion the columns of the north church were substituted with [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], the two domes were renovated, and the mosaic decoration was removed.<ref name=mw127/> After another fire in 1782,<ref name=mw128>Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 128</ref> the complex was restored again in 1847/48. In this occasion also the columns of the south church were substituted with piers, and the [[balustrade]] [[parapet]]s of the narthex were removed too.<ref name=mw128/> The building burned once more in 1918,<ref name=ey80>Eyice (1955), p. 80.</ref> and was abandoned. During excavations performed in 1929, twenty-two [[sarcophagi]] have been found.<ref name=ey80/> The complex has been thoroughly restored between the 1970s and 1980s by the Byzantine Society of America, and since then serves again as a mosque.<ref name=mw128/>

==Architecture and decoration==
[[File:Dscn0489.jpg|thumb|Interior of the North Church.]]

===North church===
The ''north church'' has an unusual [[quincuncial]] ([[cross-in-square]]) plan, and was one of the first shrines in Constantinople to adopt this plan, whose prototype is possibly the ''[[Nea Ekklesia]]'' ("New Church"), erected in Constantinople in the year 880, of which no remains are extant.<ref>Krautheimer (1986), p. 388.</ref>

The dimensions of the north church are small: the ''[[Cella|naos]]'' is 13 meters long and 9.5 meters wide, and was sized according to the population living in the monastery at that time. The [[masonry]] of the northern church was erected by alternating courses of bricks and small rough stone blocks. In this technique, which is typical of the Byzantine architecture of the 10th century,<ref name="kr405">Krautheimer (1986), p. 405.</ref> the bricks sink in a thick bed of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].
 
This edifice has three high [[apse]]s: the central one is polygonal, and is flanked by the other two, which served as ''pastophoria'',<ref>The ''pastophorium '' is a room, usually near the apse, which served as ''diakonikon'' or ''prothesis''.</ref> ''[[prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]'' and ''[[diaconicon|diakonikon]]''.

The apses are interrupted by triple and single [[lancet window]]s. The walls of the central arms of the ''naos'' cross have two orders of windows: the lower order has triple lancet windows, the higher semicircular windows. Two long ''parekklesia'', each one ended by a low apse, flanks the ''presbytery'' of the ''naos''. The angular and central bays are very slender. At the four edges of the building are four small roof chapels, each surmounted by a [[cupola]]. 

The remainders of the original decoration of this church are the bases of three of the four columns of the central bay, and many original decorating elements, which survive on the pillars of the windows and on the frame of the dome. The decoration consisted originally in marble panels and coloured tiles: the vaults were decorated with [[Mosaic#Byzantine_mosaics|mosaic]]. Only spurs of it are now visible.<ref name=kr405/>

As a whole, the north church presents strong analogies with the [[Bodrum Mosque]] (the church of ''Myrelaion'').<ref>Krautheimer (1986), p. 404.</ref>

[[File:Hanci Fenari Isa Mosque N Dome.JPG|thumb|North Church Dome.]]

===South church===
The ''south church'' is a square room surmounted by a dome, and surrounded by two ''deambulatoria'',<ref>A ''deambulatorium'' is an aisle which encircles the central part of a church.</ref> an ''esonarthex'' and a ''parekklesion'' (added later). The north deambulatorium is the south parekklesion of the north church. This multiplication of spaces around the central part of the church is typical of the late Palaiologian architecture: the reason of that was the need for more space for tombs, monuments erected to benefactors of the church, etc.<ref>Krautheimer (1986), p. 457.</ref> The central room is divided from the aisles by a triple arcade. During the mass the believers were confined in the deambulatoria, which were shallow and dark, and could barely see what happened in the central part of the church. 

[[File:FeneriIsaCamiiInIstanbul20070102 2.jpg|thumb|The Dome of the ''Church of St. John the Baptist''.]]

The masonry is composed of alternated courses of bricks and stone, typical of the late Byzantine architecture in Constantinople.

The lush decoration of the south and of the main apses (the latter is heptagonal), is made of a triple order of [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s, the middle order being alternated with triple windows. The bricks are arranged to form patterns like arches, hooks, [[Meander (art)|Greek fret]]s, [[sun cross]]es, [[swastika]]s and fans.<ref>Krautheimer (1986), p. 467.</ref> Between these patterns are white and dark red bands, alternating one course of stone with two to five of bricks. This is the first appearance of this most important decorating aspect of the Palaiologian architecture in Constantinople.

The church has an exonarthex surmounted by a gallery, which was extended to reach also the north church. The ''parekklesion'' was erected alongside the southern side of the south church, and was connected with the esonarthex, so that the room surrounds the whole complex on the west and south side. Several marble [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] are placed within it. 

As a whole, this complex represents a notable example of the middle and late [[Byzantine Architecture]] in Constantinople.
