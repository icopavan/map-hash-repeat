[[File:Mary Ellen Carroll Alas, poor YORICK! film.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Mary Ellen Carroll, ''Alas, poor YORICK!'', 2008.]]
• ''Alas, poor YORICK!'', 1998/99 - 2008, is the inclusive title of four artworks. In 1998/99 the entire text from Laurence Sterne’s novel [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]] was drawn on a 72 x 50 inches sheet of Arches paper, from which a silkscreen print was produced. On the ten year anniversary of the drawing, August 8, 2008, Carroll procured a fire permit from the National Park Service in Truro, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The drawing was burned at Long Nook Beach which is located on the ocean side of the Cape in Truro. The burning of the drawing took 00:10:15:07 minutes to complete and was filmed in Super 8 which was then transferred to MiniDV and finally to 16 mm film. The ash and charcoal was removed from the sand and was used to make a drawing of the black page on Arches paper. The film was screened in New York City, through the organization Light Industry, alongside [[Rachel Harrison]] as presented by [[David Joselit]].<ref>"http://www.lightindustry.org/timebatteries"</ref> Artworks from the series were included in ''The Evryali Score'' an exhibition at [[David Zwirner Gallery]].<ref>” http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions/220/work_4783.htm”</ref><ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/arts/design/29score.html?scp=1&sq=evryali&st=cse&pagewanted=2</ref>
