<!--  Commented out: [[Image:DHORC Front 2.jpeg|250px|right|Derby H:O Racing Club {{pufc|DHORC Front 2.jpeg|date=22 October 2010}}]] -->
The '''Derby H:O Racing Club''' is one of the biggest [[slot car racing]] clubs in England and is the organiser of the international world-record breaking [[Le Mans]] 24&nbsp;Hour Race. The club has been active since 1992 when it was founded by Nick Sismey and currently holds 22 clubnight championship rounds in a year, excluding the Le Mans endurance race which concludes the season in November. The racing takes place at the [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] Leisure facility in [[Sinfin]], [[Derby]], and is currently managed by Nick Sismey (Chairman) and Phil Rees (Vice Chairman)

The club runs H:O scale cars (3&nbsp;inches in length approx) around 22 different [[Race track|circuits]] over the course of the year. All of the circuits emulate real circuits such as [[Suzuka Circuit|Suzuka]], [[Bahrain]], [[Shanghai]] and [[Monza]]. The cars reach top [[speed]]s in excess of 20mph and on [[oval]] layouts, they can average up to 18&nbsp;mph and cover 70[[ft]] in 3 seconds. DHORC uses two car types on club nights - a Group C enclosed wheel (Tomy Super G+) and an open wheeled Formula One (Tyco 440X2). The [[chassis]] cost less than £10 each, plus £5 for a painted body in your choice of colours.

It is not only the [[exciting]] high speed racing that makes DHORC so popular but also the laid back atmosphere and sense of humour that members enjoy on club nights. The club nights begin at 7:30pm and usually the last final finishes at around 10:15pm although it differs based on the number of entries on the night and also the race format. 

The timetable for the night is that every driver is entered into a [[qualifying]] group, usually in their class of either adults, juniors or non-members. They then have four qualifying races, three minutes on each of the four [[lanes]]. Laps are totalled up to give the qualifying result. A set of finals is generated with 3 competitors in each final with the 'A' being the top flight final. The finals begin with the 'D' then 'C', 'B' and so on with the winner of each final climbing into the empty lane in next final thus making it possible to qualify last but finish first. 

DHORC is also popular because of its cheap membership cost and low equipment prices. For an adult it membership for the entire season of 22 races currently costs just £20 and for Juniors only £10.

== 2009 Season ==

The 2009 Derby HO Racing Club has been one of the most competitive seasons in recent years with five different winners to date (up until round 19). The season started with Lee Pateman taking a dominant victory at the new super-fast Reims circuit, followed by Jamie Sismey, who then went onto take a commanding lead in the championship with back to back victories in the second and third rounds of the year. Lee got his title bid back on track with a win on the Thruxton layout in Round 4, before the returning five-time champion Martin Chadwick launched himself into the fray with back to back victories in Rounds 5 & 6.

== 2008 Season ==

Wayne Lander became only the second DHORC racer to win the Adult Championship three years in a row in 2008, equalling John Tague's record set in the 1990s.  He actually cleaned up all four championships for the first time, taking home the DHORC Challenge, King of Speed and sharing the Team Championship with Shloke Anand. The main Championship wasn’t the walk over it had been the previous two years however, with Wayne only taking the chequered flag first on ten occasions, but he was still the main man to beat!{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
 
Nick Sismey maintained his 2007 Championship placing with second again in 2008, but this time he took seven race wins compared to the two last year, giving Wayne much more of a run for his money. This was Nick's best performance since his last Championship win in 1999.
 
Jamie Sismey had his best Adult year to date, this being the former double Junior Champion's third year in the senior category. He came very close on several occasions to his second career victory but had to settle for two Pole Positions, four Fastest Laps and two Best Race Laps on the night. He needed second at the last race at Le Mans to guarantee him third in the Championship, which he duly scored!

Liam Smith's Championship winning year started with him having much stronger opposition than it finished, with Kane Ashworth and Mitchell Warren giving him a fight over the first 14 meetings. After they left Liam was able to put together eight straight victories that eased him into his first Championship. He also took home the DHORC Challenge and King of Speed, an excellent performance in only his second year at the club. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

=== 2007 Championship Review ===
[[Image:wayne.jpeg|300px|right|2006 and 2007 DHORC Champion Wayne Lander]]

==== The Wayne Lander Domination====

2007 in the history of DHORC will be remembered for many things, however the unprecedented domination that came from Wayne Lander was something that will always stand out from the season. Wayne scored a record 16 race victories in a year, beating Lee Pateman's record of 14 set a few years ago, and also wrapping up the championship at one of the earliest points in the history of the club. Wayne's championship begun with an incredible seven consecutive race victories, allowing nobody else to even enter the race for the championship at that point in the season. He then won another nine races over the course of the next 15 events, wrapping the year up in style with victory at Le Mans after qualifying down in sixth place. Wayne's 2007 championship adds to his 2006 triumph, and in his 81 meetings attended, he has scored 31 victories, meaning that his ranking is currently at number one.

==== Veterans Guard Their Positions ====

Club organisers Nick Sismey and Phil Rees, as well as bringing record numbers of members into the club in 2007, also managed to score second and third places in the championship, with two race victories each. 1992, 1998 and 1999 Club Champion and Chairman Nick Sismey scored two victories, on the Shanghai and Thruxton track layouts. Phil Rees also broke his 8-year winless streak with two victories in 2007, scoring the most laps in the finals on the Jacarepagua and Monza layouts.

==== The Rise Of The Young Guns ====

One of the biggest stories of 2007 in DHORC was the rise of young guns in the adult class. 2003 and 2004 Junior Champion Jamie Sismey finally scored his first overall race victory at the age of 17 on the Oschersleben circuit en route to finishing in fourth place in the championship. Jamie also scored his first pole position on the Rio de Janeiro 10-lane layout. Reigning Junior Champion from 2006 Tom Measham had a solid debut season in the adults class, finishing in fifth place in the championship. His championship finished on a high when he scored his debut pole position at the final round at Le Mans, then finished second after a duel with Wayne Lander for the victory. Martin Allsopp also enjoyed a major improvement throughout the year, scoring his first podium finish at the penultimate round of the season and finishing in sixth place in the championship. His improved form contributed massively to his and Tom Measham's Team Championship victory.

Shloke Anand and Andy Fearn also had good seasons in 2007. In their first season, they both made massive progress with Shloke (finishing 10th in the standings), making it into numerous 'B' finals and scoring some good finishing positions. Andy also had a good season finishing in 11th place, scoring a fourth place finish on the Indianapolis Oval layout and also setting the most F1 race laps overall in the finale at Le Mans. No doubt in future, these young drivers will form a part of the winner's circle.

==== Good Results for Club Regulars & Alan Bullock's Return ====

Long-time member Nick Lambert enjoyed one of his best years in the club to date in 2007 finishing in seventh place in the championship with a best finish of second at the Rio oval event. Lee Pateman and Gary Weston both had a solid 2007, with former champion Lee Pateman being unable to complete the required 14 rounds, therefore missing out on a higher position, although he did record a victory in the Brands Hatch event in May. Lee finished eighth in the championship ahead of Gary Weston, who finished in 9th place. Club Treasurer Peter Barber finished in 13th place in the standings and continued to fill his trophy cabinet with wooden spoons although on many occasions Andy Dobbins tried very hard to de-thrown him, with Roy Masters continuing to race with his peculiar home-made controller, finishing 14th in the final standings.

One of the biggest stories for DHORC in 2007, however, was the huge welcome return of Alan Bullock, who after missing just three events while recovering in hospital from having a leg amputated, returned to the club and recorded a sensational 12th place in the championship standings.

==== Record number of new members====

In 2007 there was a record number of new members joining the club with 14 new faces that year. Nick Wright was the highest finishing adult new face, finishing in fifteenth place, ahead of another newcomer Andy Dobbins who was ahead of Nick Wright's brother in 17th. Other new faces in the adult category include Chris Wilkinson, Sam Siddons, Lyden Copely and Peter Zimmerman. There was also a large number of interest in the Juniors towards the end of the year as preparations began for what looks to be a fiercely contested 2008 Junior Championship.
