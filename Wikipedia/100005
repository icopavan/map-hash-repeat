A '''grebe''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|b}}) is a member of the '''Podicipediformes''' [[order (biology)|order]], a widely distributed order of freshwater diving [[Aves|bird]]s, some of which visit the sea when [[Bird migration|migrating]] and in winter. This order contains only a single [[family (biology)|family]], the '''Podicipedidae''', containing 22 [[species]] in 6 extant [[genus|genera]]. 

==Description==
[[File:Diving grebe.jpg|[[Diving]] grebe|left|thumb]]
Grebes are small to medium-large in size, have lobed toes, and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, although they can run for a short distance, they are prone to falling over, since they have their feet placed far back on the body.

Grebes have narrow wings, and some species are reluctant to fly; indeed, two [[South America]]n species are completely flightless.<ref name=EoB/> They respond to danger by diving rather than flying, and are in any case much less wary than [[duck]]s. Extant species range in size from the [[Least Grebe]], at 120&nbsp;grams (4.3&nbsp;oz) and 23.5&nbsp;cm (9.3&nbsp;inches), to the [[Great Grebe]], at 1.7&nbsp;kg (3.8&nbsp;lbs) and 71&nbsp;cm (28&nbsp;inches).

However, the [[North America]]n and [[Eurasia]]n species are all, of necessity, migratory over much or all of their ranges, and those species that winter at sea are also seen regularly in flight. Even the small freshwater [[Pied-billed Grebe]] of North America has occurred as a transatlantic [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] to Europe on more than 30 occasions.

Bills vary from short and thick to long and pointed, depending on the diet, which ranges from fish to freshwater insects and crustaceans. The feet are always large, with broad lobes on the toes and small webs connecting the front three toes. The hind toe also has a small lobe. Recent experimental work has shown that these lobes work like the [[hydrofoil]] blades of a propeller.<ref name=EoB>{{cite book |editor=Forshaw, Joseph|author=Fjeldså, John|year=1991|title=Encyclopaedia of Animals: Birds|publisher=Merehurst Press|location=London|pages=59–60|isbn=1-85391-186-0}}</ref> Curiously, the same mechanism apparently [[Evolution|evolved]] independently in the extinct [[Cretaceous]]-age [[Hesperornithiformes]], which are totally unrelated birds.

Grebes have unusual [[feather|plumage]]. It is dense and waterproof, and on the underside the feathers are at right-angles to the skin, sticking straight out to begin with and curling at the tip. By pressing their feathers against the body, grebes can adjust their [[buoyancy]]. Often, they swim low in the water with just the head and neck exposed.

In the non-breeding season, grebes are plain-coloured in dark browns and whites. However, most have ornate and distinctive breeding plumages, often developing chestnut markings on the head area, and perform elaborate display rituals.<ref name=EoB/> The young, particularly those of the ''[[Podiceps]]'' genus, are often striped and retain some of their juvenile plumage even after reaching full size.

When [[preening]], grebes eat their own feathers, and feed them to their young. The function of this behaviour is uncertain but it is believed to assist with pellet formation,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Simmons|title=Feather-eating and Pellet-formation in the Great Crested Grebe|journal=Brit. Birds|volume=49|pages=432–435|year=1956}}</ref>  and to reduce their vulnerability to gastric [[parasite]]s.

Grebes make floating nests of plant material concealed among reeds on the surface of the water. The young are [[precocial]], and able to swim from birth.<ref name=EoB/>

==Systematics and evolution==
The grebes are a radically distinct group of birds as regards their [[anatomy]]. Accordingly, they were at first believed to be related to the [[loon]]s, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both families were once classified together under the order [[Colymbiformes]]. However, as recently as the 1930s, this was determined to be an example of [[convergent evolution]] by the strong [[selection|selective]] forces encountered by unrelated birds sharing the same lifestyle at different times and in different habitat.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stolpe|first= M. |year=1935|title=''Colymbus, Hesperornis, Podiceps'':, ein Vergleich ihrer hinteren Extremität|journal=[[Journal of Ornithology|J. Ornithol.]]|volume=80|issue=1|pages=161–247|language=German|doi=10.1007/BF01908745}}</ref> Grebes and loons are now separately classified orders of Podicipediformes and Gaviiformes, respectively.

The [[cladistics]] vs. [[phenetics]] debate of the mid-20th century  revived scientific interest in generalizing comparisons. As a consequence, the discredited grebe-loon link was discussed again. This even went as far as proposing [[monophyly]] for grebes, loons, and the toothed [[Hesperornithiformes]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cracraft|first= Joel|year=1982|url= Phylogenetic relationships and monophyly of loons, grebes, and hesperornithiform birds, with comments on the early history of birds|journal=Systematic Zoology|volume=31|pages=35–56|doi=10.2307/2413412|title=Phylogenetic Relationships and Monophyly of Loons, Grebes, and Hesperornithiform Birds, with Comments on the Early History of Birds|issue=1}}</ref> In retrospect, the scientific value of the debate lies more in providing examples that a cladistic ''[[methodology]]'' is not incompatible with an overall phenetical scientific ''[[doctrine]]'', and that thus, simply because some study "uses cladistics", it does not guarantee superior results.

Molecular studies such as [[DNA-DNA hybridization]] (Sibley & Ahlquist, 1990){{full}} and [[DNA sequence|sequence]] analyses fail to resolve the relationships of grebes properly due to insufficient resolution in the former and [[long-branch attraction]] in the latter. Still – actually ''because'' of this – they do confirm that these birds form a fairly ancient evolutionary lineage (or possibly one that was subject to selective pressures down to the molecular level even), and they support the ''non-''relatedness of loons and grebes.

===Relationship with flamingos===
[[File:Phoenicopteridae face.JPG|thumb|Many molecular and morphological studies support a relationship between grebes and [[flamingo]]s.]]
Recent molecular studies have suggested a relation with [[flamingo]]s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chubb|first=A.

They hold at least eleven morphological traits in common, which are not found on other birds. Many of these characteristics have been previously identified on flamingos, but not on grebes.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1096-3642.2003.00094.x | last = Mayr | first = Gerald | authorlink = Gerald Mayr | title = Morphological evidence for sister group relationship between flamingos (Aves: Phoenicopteridae) and grebes (Podicipedidae) | journal = [[Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society]] | volume = 140 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–169 | year = 2004 | url = http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/terrzool/ornithologie/flamingo.pdf | issn = 0024-4082 | accessdate = November 3, 2009}}</ref> The fossil [[Palaelodidae|Palaelodids]] can be considered evolutionarily, and ecologically, intermediate between flamingos and grebes.<ref name="Gottingen">{{Cite journal | last = Mayr | first = Gerald | authorlink = Gerald Mayr | title = The contribution of fossils to the reconstruction of the higher-level phylogeny of birds | journal = Species, Phylogeny and Evolution | volume = 1 | pages = 59–64 | year = 2006 | url = http://www.senckenberg.de/files/content/forschung/abteilung/terrzool/ornithologie/gottingen.pdf | issn = 1098-660X | doi = | id = | accessdate = 12 August 2009}}</ref>

For the grebe-flamingo [[clade]], the [[taxon]] [[Mirandornithes]] ("miraculous birds" due to their extreme divergence and apomorphies) has been proposed. Alternatively, they could be placed in one order, with Phoenocopteriformes taking priority.<ref name="Gottingen"/>

===Fossil grebes===
[[Image:Juncitarsus merkeli.JPG|thumb|150px|left|''Juncitarsus merkeli'' fossil]] 
The [[fossil record]] of grebes is incomplete; there are no transitional forms between more conventional birds and the highly derived grebes known from fossils, or at least none that can be placed in the relationships of the group with any certainty.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} The enigmatic waterbird [[genus]] ''[[Juncitarsus]]'', however, may be close to a common ancestor of flamingos and grebes.

The [[Early Cretaceous]] ([[Berriasian]], around 143 [[mya (unit)|mya]]) genus ''[[Eurolimnornis]]'' from NW [[Romania]] was initially believed to be a grebe. If it is indeed related to this lineage, it must represent a most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] form, as it almost certainly predates any grebe-flamingo split. On the other hand, the single bone fragment assigned to this taxon is not very diagnositc and may not be of a bird at all.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Benton|first=M. J.|coauthors=Cook, E.; Grigorescu, D.; Popa, E.; & Tallódi, E. |year=1997|title= Dinosaurs and other tetrapods in an Early Cretaceous bauxite-filled fissure, northwestern Romania|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=130|pages= 275–292|doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(96)00151-4|url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Benton/reprints/1997Romania.pdf|format= PDF}}</ref>

''[[Telmatornis]]'' from the [[Navesink Formation]] – also Late Cretaceous – is traditionally allied with the [[Charadriiformes]] and/or [[Gruiformes]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=American Museum Novitates|issue=2388|id={{hdl|2246/2598}}|title=Systematics and evolution of the Gruiformes (class, Aves). 1, The Eocene family Geranoididae and the early history of the Gruiformes|last=Cracraft|first=Joel}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| journal=Auk|volume=47|pages=186–188|url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v047n02/p0186-p0188.pdf|issue=2|title=The Age of the Supposed Cretaceous Birds from New Jersey|first=Alexander|last=Wetmore|year=1930|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Auk|volume=84|page=260|url= http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v084n02/p0260-p0262.pdf|title=Age of Fossil Birds from the Greensands of New Jersey|year=1967|issue=2|last=Baird |first=Donald |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Auk|volume=89|pages=36–46|url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v089n01/p0036-p0046.pdf|issue=1|format=PDF|first=Joel|last=Cracraft|title=A New Cretaceous Charadriiform Family|year=1972}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal= Condor|volume=33|title=Two Primitive Rails from the Eocene of Colorado and Wyoming|format=PDF|first=Alexander|last= Wetmore|pages=107–109|url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Condor/files/issues/v033n03/p0107-p0109.pdf|year=1932|issue=3}}</ref> However, a [[cladistic]] analysis of the forelimb skeleton found it highly similar to the [[Great Crested Grebe]] and unlike the [[Painted Buttonquail]] (now known to be a [[basal (evolution)|basal]] charadriiform lineage), the [[Black-necked Stilt]] (a more advanced charadriiform), or the [[Limpkin]] (a member of the [[Grui]] [[suborder]] of Gruiformes), namely in that its [[dorsal condyle of the humerus]] was not angled at 20°–30° away from long axis of the [[humerus]]. The analysis did not result in a [[phylogenetic]] pattern but rather grouped some birds with similar wing shapes together while others stood separate. It is thus unknown whether this apparent similarity to grebes represents an evolutionary relationship, or whether ''Telmatornis'' simply had a wing similar to that of grebes and moved it like they do.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Varricchio|first= David J. |year=2002|title=A new bird from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation of Montana|journal=Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences|volume=39|issue=1|pages=19–26|url=http://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cgi-bin/rp/rp2_abst_e?cjes_e01-057_39_ns_nf_cjes|doi=10.1139/e01-057}}</ref>

True grebes suddenly appear in the fossil record in the Late [[Oligocene]] or Early [[Miocene]], around 23–25 [[mya (unit)|mya]]. While there are a few prehistoric genera that are now completely extinct, ''[[Thiornis]]'' (Late Miocene -? Early Pliocene of Libros, Spain)<ref name=AnnPal86>{{cite journal|journal=Ann. Paleontol.|volume=86|page=129}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History|volume=151|page=1}}</ref> and ''[[Pliolymbus]]'' (Late Pliocene of WC USA – Early?

Only the Early Miocene ''[[Miobaptus]]'' from [[Czechoslovakia]]<ref name=AnnPal86/> might be somewhat closer to the ancestral grebes, but more probably belongs to an extinct lineage. Indeed, ''Miobaptus'' is rivalled or even exceeded in age by a species of the modern genus ''[[Podiceps]]''.

A few more recent grebe fossils could not be assigned to modern or prehistoric genera as of now:
