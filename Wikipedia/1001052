'''Hurricane Iwa''', taken from the [[Hawaiian language]] name for the [[frigatebird]] ({{okina}}iwa, lit. "Thief"), was at the time the costliest hurricane to affect the state of [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]]. Iwa was the twenty-third tropical storm and the twelfth and final hurricane of the [[1982 Pacific hurricane season]]. It developed from an active [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure near the [[equator]] on November 19. The storm moved erratically northward until becoming a hurricane on November 23 when it began accelerating to the northeast in response to strong upper-level flow from the north. Iwa passed within 25&nbsp;miles of the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] with peak winds of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) on November 23 (November&nbsp;24 [[Coordinated Universal Time]]), and the next day it became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] to the northeast of the state.

The hurricane devastated the islands of [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]], [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], and [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] with wind gusts exceeding 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and rough seas exceeding 30&nbsp;feet (9&nbsp;m) in height. The first significant [[hurricane]] to hit the [[Hawaiian Islands]] since statehood in 1959, Iwa severely damaged or destroyed 2,345&nbsp;buildings, including 1,927&nbsp;houses, leaving 500&nbsp;people homeless. Damage throughout the state totaled $312&nbsp;million (1982&nbsp;USD, ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|312000000|1982}}}} {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). One person was killed from the high seas, and three deaths were indirectly related to the hurricane's aftermath.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Iwa 1982 track.png}}
A very active [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] of low pressure persisted along the [[equator]] in the middle of November, with westerly surface winds and windspread convection located along the trough from 140° W to 140° E. An organized circulation developed near [[Palmyra Atoll]] on November 18, and steadily developed as it drifted westward.<ref name="cphc">{{cite web|author=Central Pacific Hurricane Center|year=1982|title=1982 Central Pacific Tropical Cyclone Season|accessdate=2006-12-17|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1982.php}}</ref> Though very late in the season, warm temperatures to the south of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] due to the strongest [[El Nino]] in many years allowed the disturbance to develop into Tropical Storm Iwa on November 19 while located about 970&nbsp;miles (1,760&nbsp;km) southwest of the [[Ka Lae|southernmost point in Hawaii]]. The storm tracked slowly northward after forming and initially remained a weak tropical storm. After turning to the northeast, Iwa began slowly intensifying, and on November 23 after turning to the north-northwest Iwa strengthened into a hurricane while located 580&nbsp;miles (930&nbsp;km) southwest of the southern tip of Hawaii.<ref name="cphc"/><ref name="mwl">{{cite web|author=Mariners Weather Log|year=1983|title=Hurricane Iwa|accessdate=2006-12-17|url=http://members.aol.com/Rosendalhe/hurrican1.htm}}</ref>

Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Iwa turned and accelerated to the northeast in response to strong upper level flow to its north. The hurricane possessed sufficient moisture, instability, and upper divergence for continued intensification, and Iwa reached peak winds of 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h) late on November 23 while located 245&nbsp;miles (395&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii|Waimea]] on the island of [[Kauai]]. Its forward speed increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;mph, and Iwa passed just north of the island of Kauai on November&nbsp;23 (November&nbsp;24 in UTC). The right semicircle of the storm extended across Kauai and [[Oahu]], with gusts from 100 to 120&nbsp;mph (161 to 193&nbsp;km/h). After passing [[Hawaii]], the convection of Iwa rapidly deteriorated as it gradually lost [[tropical cyclone|tropical characteristics]]. Late on November 24, the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm, and on November 25 Iwa became an [[extratropical cyclone]] while located about 600&nbsp;miles (965&nbsp;km) northeast of Hawaii.<ref name="mwl"/>

==Impact==

Hurricane Iwa produced estimated gusts reaching 120&nbsp;mph (193&nbsp;km/h) across [[Kauai]] and [[Oahu]]. The acceleration of the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and [[storm surge]] across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near the path of the center. It is estimated the storm surge reached eight feet (two meters) on the south coast of Kaua{{okina}}i.<ref name="mwl"/> There, the surge reached 900&nbsp;feet (275&nbsp;m) inland, exceeding a [[100-year flood]] event for the area.<ref name="usgs">{{cite web|author=United States Geological Survey|year=2005|title=Summary of Significant Floods, 1982|accessdate=2006-12-22|url=http://www-ks.cr.usgs.gov/Kansas/pubs/reports/wsp.2502.sum82.html}}</ref> The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where 20.33&nbsp;inches (516&nbsp;mm) was measured.<ref>Hydrometeorological Prediction Center.

==Aftermath==

Three days after Hurricane Iwa passed the state, [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]] [[George Ariyoshi]] declared the islands of Kauai and Niihau as disaster areas and began filing papers for a federal disaster declaration.<ref name="upi1126">{{cite news|author=United Press International|date=1982-11-26|title=Hawaii Storm Cost Near $200&nbsp;Million|accessdate=2006-12-22|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&res=9402E5D71339F935A15752C1A964948260&n=Top%2fNews%2fU%2eS%2e%2fU%2eS%2e%20States%2c%20Territories%20and%20Possessions%2fHawaii|work=The New York Times}}</ref> On November 28, five days after the hurricane struck, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] declared the islands of Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu as a disaster area. The declaration allocated federal funds to aid the affected citizens.<ref name="upi1128"/> The state Department of Education decided to close all schools on Kauai indefinitely.<ref name="upi1130"/>

The thousands of Hawaiians without power celebrated [[Thanksgiving]] by cooking turkeys on outdoor grills or smokers. [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] planes delivered 20,000 Thanksgiving rations to the thousands left in temporary shelters. The United States military also airlifted generators to Kauai due to several days of power outages.<ref name="upi1126"/> By a week after the hurricane, utility crews restored power to nearly all major areas in Oahu, while 5,000 remained without power in Kauai.<ref name="upi1130"/> By around a month after the hurricane passed the island, utilities were restored to most of the entire island. All roads and highways were cleared, as well.<ref name="upi1219">{{cite web|author=United Press International|date=1982-12-19|title=Kauai Recovering from Punishment Sustained from Hurricane in November}}</ref> One 25th Infantry Division soldier at Schofield Barracks died while cleaning up after the hurricane.<ref name="cphc"/> Two people died in a traffic accident due to malfunctioning traffic lights.<ref name="adver">{{cite news|author=Michael Tsai|date=2006-07-02|title=Hurricane Iwa|publisher=Honolulu Advertiser|accessdate=2006-12-22|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/150/sesq5iwa}}</ref> Following the storm, significant redevelopment occurred in [[Poipu, Hawaii|Poipu]], where the hurricane flooded areas several hundred feet inland. [[Hurricane Iniki]] struck the same area ten years later. Officials estimate a hurricane similar to Iwa striking Oahu in 1992 could cause up to $7.5&nbsp;billion in damage (USD).<ref name="miti">{{cite web|author=Charles Fletcher, Eric Grossman, Bruce Richmond|year=2000|title=Hawaii Hazard Mitigation Forum|accessdate=2006-12-22|url=http://www.mothernature-hawaii.com/county_kauai/hurricane_what_are-kauai.htm}}</ref>

The [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] retired the name Iwa subsequent to the storm and replaced it with Io. Due to low amounts of tropical activity in the central [[Pacific Ocean]], the name Io has not since been used. Iwa was the first retired hurricane in the Central Pacific since the modern system of using Hawaiian naming began in the early 1980s, and it remains one of only four to be retired [[2007|as of 2007]].<ref name="atwc">{{cite web|author=Atlantic Tropical Weather Center|year=2006|title=Tropical Cyclone Retirement|publisher=Ablaze Productions, Inc.|accessdate=2006-12-23|url=http://www.atwc.org/pachist.txt}}</ref>
