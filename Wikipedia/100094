'''Sir Samuel Morton Peto, 1st Baronet''' (4 August 1809 &ndash; 13 November 1889) was an [[England|English]] [[entrepreneur]] and civil engineer.  A partner in [[Grissell and Peto]], he managed construction firms that built many major buildings and monuments in London, including [[The Reform Club]], [[Lyceum Theatre, London|The Lyceum]], [[Nelson's Column]] and the new [[Houses of Parliament]], which made him a millionaire.<ref>[http://www.greatbritishgardens.co.uk/harold_peto.htm "HAROLD PETO 1854 – 1933", at greatbritishgardens.co.uk]</ref> He then became one of the major contractors to build the rapidly expanding [[railways]] of the time.

==Early life==
Samuel Morton Peto was born in [[Woking]], [[Surrey]].  As a youth, he was apprenticed as a bricklayer to his uncle Henry Peto, who ran a building firm in [[London]].

==Career==
When the uncle died in 1830, Peto and his older cousin [[Thomas Grissell]] (who had been a partner to his uncle for five years), went into partnership. The firm of Grissell and Peto (1830–1847) built many well-known buildings in London, including the [[Reform Club]], the [[Oxford]] & [[Cambridge]] Club, the [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum]], and [[St James's Theatre]], [[Hungerford Market]] and [[Bloomsbury Chapel]] (1848), the first Baptist church with spires in London.  In addition, they built [[Nelson's Column]] (1843) and the vast infrastructure project of the London brick sewer.

==Railway works==
In 1834 Peto saw the potential of the newly developing [[railways]] and dissolved the connection with his uncle's building firm. He and his cousin Grissell founded a business as an independent railway contractor. His firm's first railway work was to build two stations in [[Curzon Street railway station|Curzon Street]], [[Birmingham]]. Next the firm built its first line of track, the [[Hanwell]] and Langley section of the [[Great Western Railway]], which included the [[Wharncliffe Viaduct]].<ref>Joby, p. 59.</ref> Grissell became increasingly nervous of the risks taken by Peto and dissolved the partnership in 1846.<ref name="Faith, pp. 103-104">Faith, pp. 103-104.</ref>

Peto then entered into partnership with [[Edward Betts]], who had married his sister Ann.<ref name="Faith, pp. 103-104"/> Between 1846 and 1855, the firm carried out many large railway contracts both at home and abroad, including the following:
* the South-Eastern Line; and
* the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway|London, Chatham & Dover]] lines.

In partnership with [[Thomas Brassey]], they built the following:
* the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway|London, Tilbury & Southend]] line; and
* the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] of [[Canada]].<ref>Helps. p. 109.</ref>
In the late 1850s, Peto and Betts helped to build the first railway in [[Algeria]]. Peto accompanied [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to the official opening of the line.<ref name="Faith, p. 105">Faith, p. 105.</ref> In 1854 during the [[Crimean War]] Peto, Betts and Brassey constructed the [[Grand Crimean Central Railway]] between [[Balaklava]] and [[Sevastopol]] to transport supplies to the troops at the front line.<ref>Cooke, pp. 16-64</ref> 

In February 1855, the government recognized Peto for his wartime services; he was made a '''Baronet''', of [[Somerleyton Hall]] in the County of [[Suffolk]].

King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick]] of [[Denmark]] honoured Peto for establishing the [[Flensburg–Husum–Tönning Railway Company]] and its construction of railways in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]], which led to a growing export/import trade with the Port of Lowestoft.

==Other activities==
In 1844, Peto bought [[Somerleyton Hall]] in [[Suffolk]]. He re-built the hall with contemporary amenities, as well as constructing a school and more houses in the village.  He next built similar projects in [[Lowestoft]], also in [[Suffolk]]. For many years he was the largest employer of labour in the entire world.<ref>[http://www.newhamstory.com/node/897 Samuel Peto at newhamstory.com]</ref>

In 1846, Peto became co-treasurer of the [[BMS World Mission|Baptist Missionary Society]]. From 1855 to March 1867, he was sole treasurer, resigning after personal financial difficulties.<ref>Stanley, Brian (1992: 218) ''The History of the Baptist Missionary Society 1792-1992'' 1992 Edinburgh, T. & T. Clark</ref> 

Peto served for two decades as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP).  He was elected a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member for [[Norwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Norwich]] in 1847 to 1854, for [[Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury]] from 1859 to 1865, and for [[Bristol (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol]] from 1865 to 1868.  During this time, he was one of the most prominent figures in public life.  He helped to make a guarantee towards the financing of the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, backing [[Joseph Paxton]]'s [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]].<ref name="Faith, p. 105"/>

Peto suffered in the financial crisis of 1866, and had to declare bankruptcy.  In 1868 he had to give up his seat in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], despite having the support of both [[Benjamin Disraeli]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]].  He exiled himself to [[Budapest]] and tried to promote railways in [[Russia]] and [[Hungary]].  When he returned to England, he tried to launch a small mineral railway in [[Cornwall]].  This failed.  He died in obscurity in 1889.<ref>Faith, p. 106.  He is buried with his second wife at Pembury old church, near Tonbridge, Kent.</ref>

==Family==
In May 1831, Peto married Mary Grissell, one of the sisters of his later partner Thomas Grissell.  They had four children before Mary's death in 1842:<ref>The Architecture of Sir Ernest George and His Partners, C. 1860-1922 (Hilary Joyce Grainger, 1885) [http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/239/1/uk_bl_ethos_353444_VOL1.pdf]</ref>
