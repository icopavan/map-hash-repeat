*'''Merge''' to [[American Idol (Season 6)]].--'''[[User:TBC|<font color="#007BA7">TBC</font>]]<big>Φ</big>[[User talk:TBC|<font color="#007BA7">talk?</font>]]''' 22:26, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''  Sligh is, at this point at least, only a contestant on a TV show.  Are the other eleven remaining contestants Wiki-notable even after they've been eliminated?--[[User:John Foxe|John Foxe]] 22:34, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. All of the season 5 finalists have pages. All of the season 3 finalists have pages. And I believe all of the season 4 finalists have pages. According to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Idol_series|guidelines]] set forth by the WikiProject on the subject, finalists get pages. And yes, the pages stay even after elimination. The proof is [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:American_Idol_3|here]], [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:American_Idol_4|here]], [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:American_Idol_5|here]] and [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:American_Idol_2|here]] and [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:American_Idol_1|here]]. Those are links to the "What links here" section of the templates for each season of Idol. This is the #1 show in the United States and it's highly rated elsewhere. Almost all of the contestants have had careers beyond Idol be it Broadway, CDs, fansites, etc. They are all notable if they've made the finals. I know that many people don't care for the show and many don't like that we have this many articles on the show, but I think it's necessary. And if we delete this one, then we need to delete 12 participant articles or make them all redirects...and then decided on a one-by-one basis who gets recreated after the show is on for awhile. At some point, it's easiest to keep things as they are. And the thing is, we don't know who will be successful and who won't be at this point. I mean the arguably 2 most successful acts from season 5 finished 6th (Kellie Pickler) and 4th (Chris Daughtry). I think it's just too early to ditch these. --[[User:Woohookitty|''Woohookitty'']]<sup>[[User talk:Woohookitty|Woohoo!]]</sup> 22:56, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
**'''Comment'''. So I suppose you're willing to let American Idol determine how many "finalists" there are--in this case, twelve.  When I think of the word "finalists," I think of the number two.--[[User:John Foxe|John Foxe]] 21:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
***'''Comment''' Yes because that's what the show calls them. Those who make the top 24 are semi-finalists. Those who makes the top 12 are finalists (and it's been 12 for several years now). They've been referred to as finalists since season 1. Even the earliest Wikipedia articles on these folks called them finalists. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tamyra_Gray&oldid=3649959 Here] is the first version of the article on [[Tamyra Gray]] from May 2004. And it calls her a finalist.  --[[User:Woohookitty|''Woohookitty'']]<sup>[[User talk:Woohookitty|Woohoo!]]</sup> 12:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Why would you delete a current finalist on American Idol? This is getting annoying that American Idol finalist articles are being deleted. [[Nadia Turner]]'s page got merged when she was a was in the Top 8, and is going to star in a new movie!!! It makes no sense [[User:216.54.173.184|216.54.173.184]] 23:45, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. This is starting to get rediculous. At this point he passes WP:N. If he's eliminated quickly and falls off the face of the earth that's one thing, but that hasn't happened.--[[User:Wizardman|<span style="color:#0D0;background:#009">Wizardman</span>]] 00:55, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
**I'd agree with that. I don't understand the rush. The second articles get created, they show up here. Give it some time. If it's next January and these guys aren't doing much, then we can delete. But look at someone like [[Elliott Yamin]]. He's just now getting his debut CD out and it's been almost a year since he was eliminated. Right now, all 12 finalists are notable because they are on the #1 show on television in the US. It's just like how we have articles on stars of a current, hit tv show. It's the exact same thing. --[[User:Woohookitty|''Woohookitty'']]<sup>[[User talk:Woohookitty|Woohoo!]]</sup> 11:19, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Seriously, Chris is far more famous and notable than many others who already have wiki bios. His national recognition deserves this. 5 of the other American Idol Finalists have their own pages; why not Chris? ([[User:Barang|Barang]] 01:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC))
*'''Keep'''.  As per many of the above, specifically [[User:Woohookitty|''Woohookitty'']]. &mdash; [[User:Mrmaroon25|mrmaroon25]] ([[User talk:Mrmaroon25|talk]] <small>•</small> [[Special:Contributions/Mrmaroon25|contribs]]) 04:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Deleting Chris Sligh's is like voting him off the top 12.

[[User:Derrty2033|Derrty2033]] 23:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. Keep it. I needed to find out which song he sang last week (dc Talk's Wanna Be Loved), and thanks to Wikipedia, I was able to find it very quickly and easily. ([[User:dfaber|dfaber]]
*'''Keep'''. Sligh is notable by Wikipedia standards as well as by Wikipedia consensus. This page provides useful information and should be retained.—[[User:Emote|Emote]] <sub>[[User talk:Emote|Talk Page]]</sub> 05:30, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - an argument that Chris is not a "finalist" - irregarding the fact that AI itself has determined that nomenclature for contestants in Chris' situation - cannot pass muster if other contestants like Kevin Covais (who came in 11th in Season 5) have their own free-standing bio.--[[User:Loving CA|Loving CA]] 18:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. If John Foxe is consistent, he will also mark the pages for other final 12 contestants for deletions, as several others have one. He has not done this, and if they are allowed to stay Chris Sligh's page should be as well. He is only marking this one because of the BJU connection, and thus doesn't care about the others in my opinion. --[[User:Elvanya|Elvanya]] 20:53, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
**'''Comment'''. Although [[User:Elvanya|Elvanya]] is correct in assuming that I tagged Sligh's article because of his BJU connection, I don't believe any of the 12 current contestants on American Idol are Wiki-notable unless for something other than appearing on this TV show.  But then, mine is a minority opinion to say the least.--[[User:John Foxe|John Foxe]] 21:22, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
***'''Comment'''. Foxe exhibits no regard for the overwhelming consensus (everybody except him) that Sligh is notable and should have his own page.—[[User:Emote|Emote]] <sub>[[User talk:Emote|Talk Page]]</sub> 21:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
****'''Comment'''. No I don't think you are right, Emote. He has a right to his opinion. Foxe, I think what you are forgetting is the scope of the show. It's seen by more people weekly than any other show in the United States. It is just like regulars on a hit sitcom or drama. --[[User:Woohookitty|''Woohookitty'']]<sup>[[User talk:Woohookitty|Woohoo!]]</sup> 11:45, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''  Like it or not, this guy is now a celebrity. [[User:Effer|Effer]] 21:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. This is such a one-sided debate, it makes me wonder why we are debating this at all. Let's keep the article. [[User:Pober157|Pober157]] 23:17, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
**'''Comment'''. John Foxe seems to enjoy wasting the time of as many people as possible on silly things like this. Perhaps he will someday decide to become the type of editor who makes useful contributions to the encyclopedia rather than clogging up the system with arguments like this.—[[User:Emote|Emote]] <sub>[[User talk:Emote|Talk Page]]</sub> 00:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - definitely a notable person. - [[User:Richardcavell|Richard Cavell]] 00:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - I don't think there is any reason to delete? Is Wikipedia running out of space that we can't leave up an article of Chris Sligh? [[User:Liore|Liore]] 00:28, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - As one other Wikimember pointed out, having an article about Chris here on Wikipedia makes it easy for the masses to find information, such as what song he sang last week and who it was from.  Informaton is the very point of Wikipedea; anything that promotes or falls within the category of information should be kept on Wikipedia, hands down.

*'''Keep''' per [[User:Woohookitty|Woohookitty]]. [[User:Amphytrite|Amphytrite]] 02:07, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Chris Sligh, already in top 12, already a celebrity, would be a shame to delete such a notable artist.
*'''Keep''' any contestant who makes it into the top 12, although some contestants who don't even make it that far are still notable. [[User:Everyking|Everyking]] 07:21, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''  I don't get why this would be deleted, like it or not, this guy is a celebrity --  there are plenty of musicians in wikipedia who are far less famous than Sligh. <small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[Special:Contributions/71.106.254.50|71.106.254.50]] ([[User talk:71.106.254.50|talk]]) 08:08, 14 March 2007 (UTC).</small><!-- HagermanBot Auto-Unsigned -->
*'''Strong Keep''' - Keeping with the precedent that the top 12 of American Idol, THE most popular show in America, each get their own wikipedia article.  It makes perfect sense because of the show's popularity and deleting one without deleting the others is absolutely silly.  THe user who suggested deletion clearly isn't thinking logically.  --[[User:Mystalic|Mystalic]] 12:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' I really don't understand why this is being considered for deletion since all of the other 12 finalists have pages, some much less developed than Chris', and none of those have been tagged for deletion. --[[User:Elvanya|Elvanya]] 14:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
***'''Comment'''. I'd respond but am incapable of all but incoherent babbling.--[[User:John Foxe|John Foxe]] 15:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
****'''Comment'''.  Yep, that pretty much sums it up. --[[User:Mystalic|Mystalic]] 01:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' American Idol is the number #1 show on US television at present, and this (and all other Idol-related Wiki articles on the contestants who made the finals, the show's equivalent of the "playoffs") should be considered in the vein of other top shows when describing the "cast of characters", as it were.  Sligh is a participant on this show, and therefore in the interest of the admittedly relative "historical accuracy" of the series' participants of the past, deleting the article wouldn't make much sense.  Is the proposed deletion honestly based on qualitative reasons, or "political" ones of one stripe or other?  And wouldn't a mere recommendation of expanding the article be sufficient enough for meeting Wiki's quality needs? [[User:24.117.250.51|24.117.250.51]] 10:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep for Now''' He's still a finalist, which is reason enough to keep him for the time being.  Even if he does manage to be eliminated, some Idol finalists have secured recording contracts, and there's no telling if he will. --[[User:PeanutCheeseBar|PeanutCheeseBar]] 16:19, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
*'''Speedy keep'''. All other finalists of current season of country's #1 show have pages. Deletionism!  [[User:Moncrief|Moncrief]] 21:04, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
